## Wet Milling
Wet milling of wheat is the process of separating flour into its components,primarily starch and gluten,using water in the process.This can easily be illustrated in a household kitchen.Take some flour and add enough water to form a dough ball and then knead the ball for a few minutes to allow the gluten to form.Air Swept Mill Mineral Processing & MetallurgyThe layout of such a closed circuit plant is shown in Fig.1.5.The grinding in a batch mill,a grate discharge mill or trunnion overflow mill may be performed either "wet" or "dry",but clearly in an "air swept" mill the grinding must be carried out in the dry state.
