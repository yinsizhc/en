## Rod mills,how they function
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.Rod.Ball Mills vs Rod MillsBecause of this,the rod mill can effectively reduce 1″ feed size to 10 mesh or finer in open circuit.The voids (or interstitial space) within a rod load are approximately half those in a ball mill grinding load.Rods in place weigh approximately 400 pounds per cu.ft.
