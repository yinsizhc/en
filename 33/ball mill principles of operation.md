## Ball Mills
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40%Ball MillsVery large tonnages can be ground with these ball mills because they are very effective material handling devices.Ball mills are rated by power rather than capacity.Today,the largest ball mill in operation is 8.53 m diameter and 13.41 m long with a corresponding motor power of 22 MW (Toromocho,private communications).
