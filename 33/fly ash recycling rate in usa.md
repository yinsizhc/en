## CONCRETE Optimizing the Use of Fly Ash in Concrete
2014 9 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The most widely used specification for fly ash in North America is ASTM C618 Standard Specification for Coal Fly Ash and Raw or Calcined Natural Pozzolan for Use in Concrete (AASHTO M 295).This specification divides fly ash into two classes based on its source of origin and composition as described in Table 2.MSW Combustor Ash Material Description User Guidelines.The data indicate that municipal solid waste combustor ash is a relatively lightweight material compared with natural sands and aggregate.The bulk specific gravities that were reported range from 1.5 to 2.2 for sand size or fine particles and 1.9 to 2.4 for coarse particles,compared with approximately 2.6 to 2.8 for conventional aggregate materials.
