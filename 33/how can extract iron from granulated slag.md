## Copper Slag General Information,Process,Products.
Copper slag is an abrasive blasting grit made of granulated slag from metal smelting processes (also called iron silicate).Copper slag is a by product created during the copper smelting and refining process.Copper slag is a by product obtained during the production of copper metal,which can be used as pozzolana in the production of cementing.Separating Slag From Molten Iron(fe) Patents and Patent.Finally,the slag rakes leave the space over the ladle,and discharge the slag.The de slagging rate can reach over 90%,and the process takes less than 3 minutes.Additionally,the iron carried away while scooping up the slag can be strictly controlled within 0.1%.
