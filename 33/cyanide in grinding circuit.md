Most of the gold losses through the tailings is due to a coarser size fraction (greater than 75% microns) or poor plant operation.This serves as a report on effect of grinding on cyanide leaching.Lihir Facts ProcessingAll other processing facilities are at Putput Point,approximately 1 km north east of Ladolam Creek.Crushing,Stockpiling and Reclaim.The primary crushing circuit incorporates a gyratory crusher to produce the required feed for semi autogenous grinding (SAG).

## Cyanidation in Grinding Circuit: Evaluation of Leaching.
&quot;In gold processing plants,it is common to start gold cyanidation in the grinding circuit by simple cyanide addition or as a result of recycling residual cyanide.In such cases,advantages such as a decrease in gold lockup and reduced leach time have been noticed.Cyanide permit grindinghigher grade ore is crushed,followed by gravity separation,cyanide leaching with a carbon in pulp circuit,and gold dor&#233; is produced on site.As required to meet the conditions of this permit,tailings may be subject a cyanide detoxification prior to disposal in the TSF.assay crucibles and cupels through the grinding and leaching.
