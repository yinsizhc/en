## Placer Gold vs.Lode Gold (and how to find it!)
Gold is gold,so there isn’t necessarily a better type of gold.However,mining for lode gold has many more challenges that mining for placer gold.Placer gold mining is much easier.The gold is already separated from the rock,and gravity has concentrated the gold into creeks and rivers where it is more easily accessible.Placer Mining,Gold Mining,Mineral Mining,Mining.Placer mining is the mining of alluvial sediments for minerals.This may be through by open pit (also known as open cast mining) or by a variety of forms of tunneling into antique riverbeds.Excavation might be achieved using water pressure (hydraulic mining).
