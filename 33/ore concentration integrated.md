The concentration of cerium,the most abundant rare earth,is approximately the same as that of copper although the other REEs are much rarer.However,REEs are not usually concentrated in ore deposits in amounts that can be easily or economically mined (Long,2010).Product SamarcoSamarco's product is iron ore pellets,small agglomerations made from ultrafine iron particles generated from the beneficiation of ore.Pelletizing is the process of compression or molding of such particles,which results in a spherical product ranging from 8 to 18 mm.The pellets are mainly used for fueling the blast furnaces in steel mills.
