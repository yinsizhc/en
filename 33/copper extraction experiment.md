It’s hard to imagine a world without copper.We rely on copper for power,lighting,heating,communications,water supply and transport.Copper makes our homes,schools and businesses efficient,comfortable and decorative and it lasts for many years.In this e source,we’ll look at the ways of extracting copper from the ground.The Extraction of CopperCopper can be extracted from non sulfide ores by a different process involving three separate stages: Reaction of the ore (over quite a long time and on a huge scale) with a dilute acid such as dilute sulfuric acid to produce a very dilute copper(II) sulfate solution.Concentration of the copper(II) sulfate solution by solvent extraction.

The extraction of copper also involves many steps.The ore used for extraction is copper pyrites,which is crushed,concentrated and then heated in the presence of air.During heating the moisture gets expelled and the copper pyrites gets converted to ferrous sulfide and cuprous sulfide.Copper History: Copper through the AgesCopper has been an essential material to man since pre historic times.In fact,one of the major &quot;ages&quot; or stages of human history is named for a copper alloy,bronze.Copper and it's many alloys have played an important role in many civilizations,from the ancient.
