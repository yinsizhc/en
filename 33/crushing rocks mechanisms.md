Stone crushing is important in many sectors of economy such as in construction and in mining Two types of equipment that are used in the crushing of stone are the horizontal Pittman stone crusher and the Single toggle stone crusher Both have different characteristics and mechanisms that influence their application in crushing rocks.Compaction bands due to grain crushing in porous rocks: A.Various mechanisms were identified,including: grain crushing,grain sliding,bond breaking and pore collapse.Shearing at low confining pressures facilitates the fracture of grain bonding cement,allowing the grains to rotate and slip,which could be followed by the flow of granulated materials.

## Crusher Wikipedia
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Size Reduction Visual Encyclopedia of Chemical EngineeringSize Reduction Raw materials undergo size reduction through different mechanisms: impact,compression,and attrition One way to classify size reduction equipment is into crushers and grinders,where grinders produce finer particles than crushers

## Cataclastic rock Wikipedia
A cataclastic rock is a type of fault rock that has been wholly or partly formed by the progressive fracturing and comminution of existing rocks,a process known as cataclasis.Cataclasis involves the granulation,crushing,or milling of the original rock,then rigid body rotation and translation of mineral grains or aggregates before lithification.Crushing in Mineral ProcessingIn mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.

## Chipping and crushing mechanisms in orthogonal rock.
The rock removal mechanism in the rock cutting process includes crushing and chipping failure modes.Crushed and powdery chips are attributed to the crushing mode while chunk like chips are formed due to the chipping mode.Chipping of rock has been concluded to be caused by either tensile or shear stresses by different researchers.
