## What Is The Environmental Impact Of The Mining Industry.
The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process.Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine,depending on the nature and location of the ore body.Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator,so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms an essential part of the geological.Basics of an open pit mine Mine Engineer.ComThe definition of a open pit mine is "an excavation or cut made at the surface of the ground for the purpose of extracting ore and which is open to the surface for the duration of the mine's life." To expose and mine the ore,it is generally necessary to excavate and relocate large quantities of waste rock.

## Tailings Wikipedia
Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.The Mining Process Waihi GoldDump trucks haul the rock to the primary crushers in the open pit or to the ore stockpiles from underground.See more detail on mining.2.Crushing The primary crushers loed at the open pit mine site,receive ore and waste at separate times.They break the larger rocks down to a size suitable for transport on the conveyor belt.

Mineral extraction (mining) and petroleum and gas production are major resource extraction activities that provide the raw materials to support our economic infrastructure.An enormous amount of pollution is generated from the extraction and use of natural resources.The Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Releases Inventory report lists mining as the single largest source of toxic waste.Potential Human Health Effects of Uranium Mining.Uranium mining and processing are associated with a wide range of potential adverse human health risks.Some of these risks arise out of aspects of uranium mining and processing specific to that enterprise,whereas other risks apply to the mining sector generally and still others are linked more broadly to large scale industrial or construction activities.
