## Igneous vs Metamorphic vs Sedimentary Rocks Difference
The most common sedimentary rocks include sandstone,shale,and limestone.About 75% to 80% of the earth’s land mass is composed of sedimentary rocks.The earth’s crust,however,is made up of only 5% sedimentary rocks.Sedimentary Rock ExamplesSedimentary rocks make up most of the rocks on the earth and are formed when bits of rock,soil or organic matter settles and accumulat Plant and animal fossils can be found in sedimentary rock When there is an abundance of plants and animals,fossil fuels develop,like oil,natural gas and coal

## Types of Sedimentary Rock ThoughtCo
Sedimentary rocks form at or near the Earth's surface.Rocks made from particles of eroded sediment are called clastic sedimentary rocks,those made from the remains of living things are called biogenic sedimentary rocks,and those that form by minerals precipitating out of solution are called evaporites.Sedimentary Rocks sun.iwu.eduThe rock name will be limestone if it's made of.and sedimentary structures of sedimentary rocks provide valuable clues to both the source region and the immediate.
