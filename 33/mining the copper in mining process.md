## Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining &amp; …
2020 1 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper,iron and sometimes other metals.Such ores originate from sulfur bearing volcanic magmas,which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.Mine Engineer.Com provides mining,gold,copper,coal.Copper Mining Info The above flowsheet shows a basic copper mine process,from mine to metal.There are two distinct types of copper ore,the sulfide ore and the oxide ore.The sulfide ores are beneficiated in flotation cells,while the oxide ores are generally leached.First the copper ore from a open pit mine is blasted,loaded and.

## copper mining process
copper mining process :Copper ore divides into ore sulfide,ore oxide and mixing ore according to its oxide rate.The main process for copper ore is flotation,for refractory mixed copper ore and refractory oxide ore,normally use hydrometallurgy process.From Ore to Finished Product2020 1 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.
