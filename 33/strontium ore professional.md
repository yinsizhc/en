## What Is Strontium? Everything You Need To Know
The key thing to understand about strontium forms is that natural strontium salts are completely safe when you take them at the right dosage (more on that in just a moment.) But strontium ranelate,the synthetic drug form of strontium can cause a whole host of adverse side effects.Below we outline the three main forms of strontium in more detail:Strontium Element information,properties and uses.Strontium 90,a radioactive isotope,is a by product of nuclear reactors and present in nuclear fallout.It has a half life of 28 years.It is absorbed by bone tissue instead of calcium and can destroy bone marrow and cause cancer.

Strontium has four stable,naturally occurring isotopes: 84 Sr (0.56%),86 Sr (9.86%),87 Sr (7.0%) and 88 Sr (82.58%).Only 87 Sr is radiogenic; it is produced by decay from the radioactive alkali metal 87 Rb,which has a half life of 4.88 × 10 10 years.Thus,there are two sources of 87 Sr in any material: first the portion formed in stars along with the isotopes 84 Sr,86 Sr,and 88 Sr.Strontium Rich Foods Our Everyday LifeStrontium is a trace mineral that is good for bone health.It is a silver gray metal that occurs naturally in nature.Strontium is assimilated in the body in the same way as calcium.In the body,strontium is absorbed into the bloodstream and also behaves similarly.
