## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses,…The large balls tend to break down the coarse feed materials and the smaller balls help to form fine product by reducing void spaces between the balls.Ball mills grind material by impact and attrition.The degree of milling in a ball mill is influenced by; The size
