## Frequent problems during grinding grindaix GmbH
The grinding of parts (workpieces) is a frequent but not trivial machining process for metallic parts.Many influencing variables are decisive and even small changes to the settings on the grinding machine or to the coolant lubricant supply may lead to grinding burn.What is the difference between lapping and honing.2020 3 4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Whereas,honing is controlled grinding.To give a better surface finish to a slot,honing is used.For example,the slot for the entry of key between the gudgeon pin and piston is honed to get a better accuracy and surface finish.Abrasive material is always used in honing.Kindly correct me if i'm wrong.
