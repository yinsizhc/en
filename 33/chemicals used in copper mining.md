Copper has low chemical reactivity.In moist air it slowly forms a greenish surface film called patina; this coating protects the metal from further attack.Applications.Most copper is used for electrical equipment (60%); construction,such as roofing and plumbing (20%); industrial machinery,such as heat exchangers (15%) and alloys (5%).Water Requirements of the Copper Industry USGSchemical quality of the water used by the copper industry.A large part of this water was used in Arizona,Nevada,New Mexico,and Utah,where about five sixths of the domestic copper is mined.
