## Iron ore Wikipedia
Banded iron formations occur exclusively in Precambrian rocks,and are commonly weakly to intensely metamorphosed.Banded iron formations may contain iron in carbonates (siderite or ankerite) or silicates (minnesotaite,greenalite,or grunerite),but in those mined as iron ores,oxides (magnetite or hematite) are the principal iron mineral.Banded iron formation WikipediaBanded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age.A typical banded iron formation consists of repeated,thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides,either magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) or hematite (Fe 2 O 3),alternating with bands of iron.
