## US4401638A Process for purifying silica sand Google.
A process of purifying silica sand comprises grinding sandstone,washing and desliming the ground sandstone to remove the major part of the clay type binder,attrition scrubbing the deslimed sand particles to release further amounts of binder therefrom,washing and desliming to remove said binder,drying and heating the sand particles,treating the hot sand with sulfuric acid to convert the.New process creates silica compounds from rice waste Materials.11 Jan 2016.Scientists have developed a new process that can produce silica compounds from the hulls left over from processing rice.Headquartered in Ann Arbor,it&#39;s currently in the process of building a &#39;pre pilot&#39; plant that will be used to develop a scaled up manufacturing process.If the scale up is successful,&nbsp;.
