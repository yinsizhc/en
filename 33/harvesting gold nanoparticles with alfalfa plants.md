## Gold nanoparticles from plants — Science Learning Hub
Why gold from plants? Gold nanoparticles can easily be got by mixing chemicals in a beaker.However,there is another problem.In a beaker,the gold nanoparticles tend to clump together and grow in size,and so become less reactive as a catalyst.Surfactants can be added to restrict particle size these bind to the surfaces of the nanoparticles,surrounding them and stopping them from growing.Vedpriya Arya &quot;Living systems: eco friendly…oxidation state to zero oxidation state or formation of gold nanoparticles [1,3,4].of an environmental friendly method to remediate mining wastes41.This discovery was made after alfalfa sprouts germinated on gold chloride enriched agar.
