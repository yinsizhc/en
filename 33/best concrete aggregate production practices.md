Aggregates for concrete are chosen carefully.Aggregates comprise 60 to 75 percent of the total volume of concrete.The type and size of the aggregate mixture depends on the thickness and purpose of the final concrete product.Relatively thin buildings sections can require small coarse aggregates,though aggregates up to six inches (150 mm) in.Concrete Technology and Aggregate Production for St.Curing practices and high lift versus low lift construction were sources of the major differences between Canadian and United States practices on the St.Lawrence Seaway.Contrasting materials and mixing specification require ments are also reported.Both United States and Canadian aggregate production procedures and equipment are detailed.

This study proposes the use of a new pelletization process to convert fresh unused concrete into an artificial aggregate,which can be reintroduced into the concrete production cycle.Specifically,the investigation focuses on the properties of two pelletized recycled aggregates (PRAs) derived from two sources of an unsettled cementitious mixture.TIP 3 Aggregate Sampling for Laboratory TestsAt a ready mixed concrete plant aggregates are typically stored in a bin or a stockpile.The process of taking a sample of aggregate that is truly representative of the nature and condition of the aggregate in the stockpile,bin or transfer point is called aggregate sampling.ASTM D75 is the standard practice for sampling aggregates.
