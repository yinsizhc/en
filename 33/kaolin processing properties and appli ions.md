## Kaolinite Wikipedia
Kaolinite ( ˈ k eɪ ə l ɪ n aɪ t ) is a clay mineral,part of the group of industrial minerals with the chemical composition Al 2 Si 2 O 5 4.It is a layered silicate mineral,with one tetrahedral sheet of silica (SiO 4) linked through oxygen atoms to one octahedral sheet of alumina (AlO 6) octahedra.Rocks that are rich in kaolinite are known as kaolin ˈ k eɪ ə l ɪ n or china clay.What is Kaolin? Industrial Minerals Association North.The name kaolin derives from the Chinese and means high ridge.High ridge is a reference to the hill in south eastern China where the clay was originally discovered and used.In the 7th and 8th centuries,the Chinese were the first to use kaolin to make porcelain.

## Characterization and thermal behavior of kaolin SpringerLink
Mar 18,2011 · The decomposition behavior of kaolin samples has been carried out by simultaneous TG DTA experiments.New layer structure formation during the calcination process was found,and metakaolin compound was detected between 600 and 900 °C.The thermal stability of kaolin samples was then identified by TG DTA,and the results are confirmed by characterization of X ray powder.
