## Longwall Mining Overview Introduction …
LONGWALL MINING Overview.In the method of secondary extraction known as longwall mining a relatively long mining face (typically in the range 100 to 300m but may be longer) is created by driving a roadway at right angles between two roadways that form the sides of the longwall block,with one rib of this new roadway forming the longwall face.Measuring mining safety with injury statistics: LostMethod: Our method was to use a beta distribution to model the losses and to compare underground coal mining to underground metal nonmetal mining from 2000 to 2004.Results: Our results showed the probability of an injury having 10 or more lost workdays was 0.52 for coal mine cases versus 0.35 for metal nonmetal mine cases.

## Crusher
2020 2 5&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Coal mining WikipediaThere are six principal methods of underground mining: Longwall mining accounts for about 50 percent of underground production.The longwall shearer has a face of 1,000 feet (300 m) or more.It is a sophisticated machine with a rotating drum that moves mechanically back and forth across a wide coal.
