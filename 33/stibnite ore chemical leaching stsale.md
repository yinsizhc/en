## US Patent for Electrowinning of metal from sulphide ores.
Process and apparatus for the electrowinning of metals from sulphide ores wherein a sulphide ore is initially leached in a water soluble sulphide solution,alkali is then added,and the resulting solution is electrolyzed so as to deposit metal at the cathode and obtain water soluble sulphide as a by product.The process is particularly suitable for obtaining antimony from stibnite.KINETIC STUDY OF LEACHING STIBNITE IN SODIUM HYDROXIDE …Concentration of leaching solution at the reaction interface and the interface area are determining the rate of chemical reaction.A study of kinetics of leaching natural stibnite by using sodium hydroxide solution requires an experimental determination of variation

## Stibnite Antimony Ore From Italy
Stibnite is the most important ore of the element antimony and is an industrially important mineral.It was used as a metallic cosmetic in ancient civiliation.Stibnite also forms some of the most exceptional crystal formations of all minerals and large and wellStibniteThe rate of oxidation of stibnite is strongly dependent on pH with appreciable dissolution at pH 12,reducing to low levels at pH 10.Figure 52.1 shows Hedley and Tabachnick's (1958) results of the cyanidation of a synthetic ore containing 0.25% stibnite at pH values of 10,11,and 12.

## KINETIC STUDY OF LEACHING STIBNITE IN SODIUM.
Concentration of leaching solution at the reaction interface and the interface area are determining the rate of chemical reaction.A study of kinetics of leaching natural stibnite by using sodium hydroxide solution requires an experimental determination of variation of antimony recoveryBiological Chemical Oxidation of Ore Minerals at Pezinok …There are discussed differences between chemical and biological chemical leaching activity of various ore minerals at the surface of polished sections.The extent of the leaching of sulphide minerals is significantly higher than that without bacteria
