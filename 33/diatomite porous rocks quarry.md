(2011)investigated the use of diatomite as the filler in porous asphalt mixtures and resulted in better interface adhesion,and low temperature cracking resistance.On this basis,the diatomite is seen to have potential to be used as filler in porous asphalt and the extension of the study is necessary.Diatomite: Its Characterization,Modifications and.Diatomite rock is a loose,earthy or loosely cemented porous and lightweight rock of sedimentary origin,mainly formed by fragments of armor (skeletons) of diatom algae: diatomea and radiolaria.Diatomite is a microscopic diatom alga whose size ranges from 0.75 to 1500 m; sometimes this rock is called infusorial earth,kieselguhr,or mountain meal.
