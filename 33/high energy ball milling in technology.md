1.Introduction.High energy ball milling (HEBM) is known as an economic,simple and yet powerful method for the production of nanostructured and amorphous materials.The prolonged milling of powder mixtures,results in the formation of supersaturated solid solution,non equilibrium intermetallic compounds as well as the formation of silicides,nitrides,stable or unstable carbides.High energy ball milling and supercritical carbon dioxide,Dec 01,2016&#0183;&#32;The MDSC results show that high energy ball milling is capable of forcing the mixing of TD and SL at a molecular level,providing a homogeneous amorphous solid solution The glass transition temperatures (Tg),determined for the co milled formulations,range from 79&#176;C to 139&#176;C and they are higher than Tg of pure SL (ca 70&#176;C) and lower than.
