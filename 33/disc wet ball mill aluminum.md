## Wet vs Dry Grinding
Jan 30,2012 · Hope I'm posting in the correct area.I would like to know what the advantages of wet grinding compared to dry grinding are (if any).Would one expect wet ground material to exhibit different leaching characteristics from dry ground materials,even when particle size distributions are identical? I'm dealing with uranium ores in a lab scale ball mill (Bond Ball Mill).Grinding Mills 911MetallurgistGrinding in small plants,as in larger installations,has proven to be the most costly of all unit operations from both capital and operating standpoints.Therefore,grinding deserves the most scrutiny of all operations during the design procedure.A recent survey by a major grinding mill manufacturer reveals that more than 80 autogenous or semi autogenous mills having between 100 and 1,000.
