## 8 Principles of Centerless Grinding Metal Cutting
Centerless grinding involves the part being supported on a workpiece rest blade that sits between two rotating cylinders: A regulating wheel,which controls the part's rotational speed and feed rate (for the infeed method) or linear travel (for the throughfeed method) A larger abrasive grinding wheel.The workpiece is held in place by theTroubleshooting NORITAKE CO.LIMITEDWhen a problem occurs while grinding,finding the cause is not easy due to the variety of complexly intertwined factors involved.In order to investigate the cause of problems,it's important to understand what is going on during grinding — things like the condition of the workpiece,the condition of the wheel usage surface,and sound and heat generated by the process — by being.
