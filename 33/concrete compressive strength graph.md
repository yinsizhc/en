QuoraThe compressive strength gained by concrete after 1,3,7,14 and 28 days with respect to the grade of concrete is shown in table.Finally,when its strength have reached 99% in 28 days,still concrete continues to gain strength after that period,but that rate of gain in compressive strength is very less compared to that in 28 days.

## Different Grades of Concrete,Their Strength and Selection.
Grade of concrete is defined as the minimum strength the concrete must posses after 28 days of construction with proper quality control.Grade of concrete is denoted by prefixing M to the desired strength in MPa.For example,for a grade of concrete with 20 MPa strength,it will be denoted by M20,where M stands for Mix.Effect of Concrete Strength and Slab Thickness on Floor.The specification for the floor of a maintenance building called for a 6 inch slab thickness and concrete with a design compressive strength of 3000 psi.The actual average cylinder strength for the floor concrete was 3630 psi.
