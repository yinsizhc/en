## INTRODUCTION TO MINING Ciência Viva
INTRODUCTION TO MINING 1.1 MINING’S CONTRIBUTION TO CIVILIZATION Mining may well have been the second of humankind’s earliest endeavors— granted that agriculture was the ﬁrst.The two industries ranked together as the primary or basic industries of early civilization.Little has changed in theMINERAL EXPLORATION AND MINE DEVELOPMENTpublic policies influencing mining,and mineral prices and production costs.In addition,and not part of this paper,mine site exploration takes place at or in the vicinity of operating mines with the goal of extending the lives of these operations. Mining,in which ore and concentrate (or other form of semiprocessed material) are produced.

## Zinc: smelting,producing and classifiionMetalpedia
Zinc smelting is the process of converting zinc concentrates (ores that contain zinc) into pure zinc.The most common zinc concentrate processed is zinc sulfide,which is obtained by concentrating sphalerite using the froth flotation method.There are two methods of smelting zinc: the pyrometallurgical process and the hydrometallurgical process (over 90% of hydrometallurgical process is inHow Gypsum is Made AWCItions.The oldest mine in the United States,in Medicine Lodge,Kansas,was orginally opened in the 1800s by Best Brothers.Gypsum from this mine was used to make Keene’s Cement,a stucco used in home construction in the 19th century.National Gypsum,of which Gold Bond is the largest division,purchased the mine in 1938.Mines and quarries.
