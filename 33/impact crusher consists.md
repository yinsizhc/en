## HAZEMAG HORIZONTAL IMPACT CRUSHER HHI
The horizontal impact crusher type HHI basically consists of two machine components: the crushing roll and the chain conveyor.The arrangement of the crushing roll above the horizontal chain conveyor permits the chain conveyor to be applied both as feed conveyor and as discharge conveyor.What is the difference between a Cone Crusher and an.Depending on the application,impact crushers can have higher wear costs,higher maintenance,and produce more fines.Impact crushers may be used as a primary,secondary,or tertiary crusher depending on the producer's final product size needs.These crushers are available in stationary,track and mobile designs.
