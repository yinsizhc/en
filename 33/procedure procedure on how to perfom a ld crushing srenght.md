## High Strength Concrete Portland Cement Association
High strength concrete is specified where reduced weight is important or where architectural considerations call for small support elements.By carrying loads more efficiently than normal strength concrete,high strength concrete also reduces the total amount of material placed and lowers the overall cost of the structure.9 Corrugated Box Testing Methods to Ensure Packaging.Compressive strength or compression strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size,as opposed to tensile strength,which withstands loads tending to elongate.In other words,compressive strength resists compression (being pushed together),whereas tensile strength resists tension (being pulled apart).In the study of strength of materials.
