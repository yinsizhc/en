## How to calculate the quantity of cement in PCC Quora
Answer (1 of 4): Suppose the ratio of the PCC is 1:5:10,then for making 10 cum of such PCC you require,hard broken stone 9 cum; 45 cu m sand; 45 5= 09 cu m of cement one cum of cement= 1440 kg you may calculate weight of cement based on this Is it OK ?Plain Cement Concrete How to Produce and Construct A.Materials Used to Produce PCC.Cement: We generally use Portland cement as bonding material in PCC.Fine Aggregate: Sand is used as fine aggregate.The FM of sand should be 1.2 to 1.5.Coarse Aggregate: We normally use brick chips for producing PCC.Stone chips can also be used for this purpose.The size of the coarse aggregate is 20mm downgrade.
