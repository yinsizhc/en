Iron is the most magnetic of the three.The mineral magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) is a naturally occurring metallic mineral that is occasionally found in sufficient quantities to be an ore of iron.The principle ores of iron are Hematite,(70% iron) and Magnetite,(72% iron).Taconite is a low grade iron ore,containing up to 30% Magnetite and Hematite.Global Drivers for High Grade Concentrate Magnetite MinesThe amount of slag produced during the steelmaking process directly relates to the iron content of the feedstock.Higher iron content equates to less slag.The iron content of direct shipping haematite iron ore is typically 58% to 64%.High grade iron ore concentrate contains 65% to 70% iron.Slag stockpiled alongside a steel mill in China.
