Bord and pillar mining Next.This diagram shows the traditional method of bord and pillar mining.Miners first extracted coal along roadways or bords,while the coal in between the bords acted as pillars holding up the roof.Then the outer pillars were mined,leaving the roof to collapse in a controlled way as miners retreated to the exit.PREVIOUS AND CURRENT MINING METHODS.4.2.2 Continuous Miner Section From early days on the trend in bord and pillar mining was towards continuous miners (Woodruff,1966).More recently there has been an increasing trend in the industry to replace the traditional shuttle cars,battery cars and scoops by continuous.

## Coal mining Wikipedia
Most coal seams are too deep underground for opencast mining and require underground mining,a method that currently accounts for about 60 percent of world coal production.In deep mining,the room and pillar or bord and pillar method progresses along the seam,while pillars and timber are left standing to support the mine roof.Once room and pillar mines have been developed to a stopping.Design of Bord and Pillar method in coal minesFeb 27,2016 · Bord and Pillar method of mining is one of the oldest methods.3.INTRODUCTION In India,about 98% of underground output of coal is obtained by Bord and Pillar method and barely about 2% by longwall methods.The other countries where Bord and Pillar method predominates are Australia,The USA and South Africa.
