Several benches may be in operation simultaneously in different parts of,and at different elevations in the open pit mine.Open pit mines can be used in coal mining,and they are used extensively in "hard rock" mining for ores such as metal ores,copper,gold,iron,aluminum,and many minerals.Jig concentrators WikipediaJig concentrators are devices used mainly in the mining industry for mineral processing,to separate particles within the ore body,based on their specific gravity (relative density).The particles would usually be of a similar size,often crushed and screened prior to being fed over the jig bed.There are many variations in design; however the basic principles are constant: The particles are.

Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold.Gold processing BritannicaGold processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.For thousands of years the word gold has connoted something of beauty or value.These images are derived from two properties of gold,its colour and its chemical stability.The colour of gold is due to the electronic structure of the gold atom,which absorbs electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths less than 5600 angstroms.
