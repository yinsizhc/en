## Impact Crusher Working Principle
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Cone Crushers Mineral Processing & MetallurgyCone crushers are used in AG and SAG grinding circuits to increase tonnage by effectively dealing with any pebble (critical size) build up problem.Normally,heavy duty short head crushers are employed to crush pebbles.Power and crusher cavity level are the key variables for monitoring and controlling the crusher operation.

## Gyratory Crusher
Gyratory crushers are principally used in surface crushing plants.The gyratory crusher (Figure 6.5) consists essentially of a long spindle,carrying a hard steel conical grinding element,the head,seated in an eccentric sleeve.The spindle is suspended from a “spider” and,as it rotates,normally between 85 and 150 rpm,it sweeps out a conical path within the fixed crushing chamber,or.Jaw Crusher: Range,Working Principle,Application DSMACJaw crushers are used as primary crushers,or the first step in the process of reducing rock.They crush primarily by using compression.The rock is dropped between two rigid pieces of metal,one of which then moves inwards towards the rock,and the rock is crushed because it has a lower breaking point than the opposing&nbsp;.
