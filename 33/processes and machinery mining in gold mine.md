## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.Gold mining process Introduction Integrated report.To conduct our business and produce gold,certain inputs such as ore bearing resources,people and machinery are required.We invest in skills enhancement,technology development and application,and in prospecting for and developing our mineral resources and ore reserves,to ensure the economic viability and sustainability of our business.
