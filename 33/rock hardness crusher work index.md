## Impact of physical and mechanical properties of rocks on energy.
15 Nov 2014.According to this model,the specific energy of crushing depends on the specific consumption of explosives and uniaxial compressive strength.From an energy consumption viewpoint,it is clear that blasting with the intention of decreasing the Bond work index (Wi) will produce large energy savings.USING THE SMC TEST® TO PREDICT COMMINUTION CIRCUIT.USING THE SMC TEST® TO PREDICT COMMINUTION CIRCUIT PERFORMANCE.The coarse ore hardness parameter (S) makes allowance for the decrease in ore hardness.work index than the crusher (ie the ball mill is less energy efficient than a crusher and has to input more energy to do the same amount of size reduction).Hence from equation 7,to.
