In June 1976 a 600'tonne day manganese ore sinter machine,with on strand cooling,was commissioned at the plant of Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Company Pty.Ltd.at Bell Bay,Tasmania.This machine was installed in order to utilize manganese lump ore screenings generated in the preparation of raw materials prior to charging to the electric smelting furnaces.Sinter plant WikipediaSinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature,to create a product that can be used in a blast furnace.The final product,a sinter,is a small,irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals.The process,called sintering,causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the chemical.
