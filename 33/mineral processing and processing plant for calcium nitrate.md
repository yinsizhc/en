## Nitrogen Superfert
Calcium Nitrate.Where shelf life and quality is needed,calcium nitrate is a possible answer.The fertilizer has both Calcium and Nitrogen in nitrate form.Calcium has a wide range of benefits in most crops amongst them increasing shelf life in crops such as tomatoes and reducing the occurrences of diseases and pest damage.Tomato Plant Nutrient Requirements Haifa GroupThese calcium deficient leaves (Fig.16) show necrosis around the base of the leaves.The very low mobility of calcium is a major factor determining the expression of calcium deficiency symptoms in plants.Classic symptoms of calcium deficiency include blossom end rot (BER) burning of the end part of tomato fruits (Fig.17).
