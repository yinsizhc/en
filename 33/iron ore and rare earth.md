## How the iron ore rout is helping rare earth prices,
The giant mine in Bayan Obo,Inner Mongolia near Baotou City,produces the bulk of the world's rare earths and does so as a byproduct of iron ore miningChinese Workers—in Greenland? Bloomberg · Estimated value of the largest rare earth and uranium deposit in Greenland: $6.6 billion Photograph by James Balog Aurora Photos (An earlier version of this story ran online.) China is growing.Greenland is melting.So it’s only natural that thousands of Chinese workers may end up near the Arctic Circle to build a vast iron ore mine later.
