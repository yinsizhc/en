## Bayer process Wikipedia
The Bayer process is the principal industrial means of refining bauxite to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) and was developed by Carl Josef Bayer.Bauxite,the most important ore of aluminium,contains only 30 60% aluminium oxide (Al 2 O 3),the rest being a mixture of silica,various iron oxides,and titanium dioxide.The aluminium oxide must be purified before it can be refined to.Electrolytic Refining2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Electro refining.Usually the object of electrolytic refining is to separate one metal in pure form from an alloy containing a high percentage of the desired metal,copper for instance,and a number of other metals dissolved in the copper or intimately mixed with it.

## EXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE reduction.
EXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE Iron is also below carbon in the reactivity series,so therefore carbon can be used to reduce it (note: reduction can also mean to remove the oxygen from a compound).This is done in a blast furnace.The most common ore of iron is called haematite (iron(iii) oxide).Its formula is Fe 2 O 3.Copper Refining: From Ore to Market INNIn hydrometallurgy,copper concentrate undergoes refining via one of a few processes.The least common method is cementation,in which an acidic solution of copper is deposited onto scrap iron in.

## Steelmaking Wikipedia
Basic oxygen steelmaking is a method of primary steelmaking in which carbon rich molten pig iron is converted into steel.Blowing oxygen through molten pig iron lowers the carbon content of the alloy and changes it into steel.The process is known as basic due to the chemical nature of the refractories—calcium oxide and magnesium oxide—that line the vessel to withstand the high.Steps in the Modern Steelmaking ProcessPrimary steelmaking has two methods: BOS (Basic Oxygen Furnace) and the more modern EAF (Electric Arc Furnace) methods.The BOS method adds recycled scrap steel to the molten iron in a converter.At high temperatures,oxygen is blown through the metal,which reduces the carbon content to …
