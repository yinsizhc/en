## Types of Ball Mills Our Pastimes
These ball mills are often called planetary ball mills.The rotating drums are not usually detachable the material is poured into the top and the cap is replaced,like a kitchen blender.Like all ball mills,the speed and ball size have an effect on how the vertical ball mill.Planetary Ball Mill PM 400 RETSCH powerful and quick.The grinding jars are arranged eccentrically on the sun wheel of the planetary ball mill.The direction of movement of the sun wheel is opposite to that of the grinding jars in the ratio 1: 2 (or 1: 2.5 or 1: 3).The grinding balls in the grinding jars are subjected to superimposed rotational movements,the so called Coriolis forces.
