## Aluminium oxide Wikipedia
Aluminium oxide (British English) or aluminum oxide (American English) is a chemical compound of aluminium and oxygen with the chemical formula Al 2 O 3.It is the most commonly occurring of several aluminium oxides,and specifically identified as aluminium(III) oxide.About Aluminium TomagoAluminium is the most plentiful metal in the earth&#39;s crust.It is found in the form of aluminium oxide in an ore called bauxite.Alumina and bauxite are the two main raw materials in the aluminium making process.Aluminium is obtained by the electrolysis of alumina which extracts pure aluminium metal from alumina.
