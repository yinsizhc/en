## HCl Hydrochloric Leaching of Manganese Silie Ore
Previous investigators have proposed a combination pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical process to treat the manganese silie ores.The process consisted of arc melting the ore at 1,550&#176 C and then rapidly cooling the melt by quenching it in water.The resulting amorphous product was acid leached for manganese extraction.How to Apply Manganese Sulfate to Plants Home Guides.Manganese is a micronutrient that is commonly deficient in soils with a pH level above 6.5.When your plants are lacking of this mineral,they exhibit visible symptoms.For example,beans and many.
