## Which Drill Point Angle Should I be Using? Regal Cutting.
The selection of an appropriate drill point angle for your bit should be informed by questions about your application.Yes—a hole is a hole is a hole—but what is the purpose of the hole,what type of metal are you cutting into,and what are the specifications for the finished hole? In addition to the drill point angle,factors that can affect successful drilling include:Building a Brooks Stent Cutter Grinder GadgetBuilderBuilding a Brooks Stent Cutter Grinder.Last Modified: Click to Enlarge.I eventually returned to my old notion of building a Brooks Stent (the plans disappeared from that site in January '07 after I copied them to my disk : ) to sharpen end mills.

## Cutting performance of end mills with different helix angles
In this paper an investigation of the cutting performance of several end mills with right and left hand helix angles is reported.Cutting tests were performed on aluminum alloy L65 for three milling processes in which cutting force,surface roughness and concavity of a machined plane surface were measured.Difference Between a Lathe & a Milling Machine Career TrendLathes and milling machines are both used for cutting raw material,but they have very different ways of doing so.Lathes spin the material,whereas a milling machine uses a spinning tool for various cutting operations.To utilize either,you must know the differences between the two and what each is capable of.
