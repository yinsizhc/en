## Gold Refining Techniques Sciencing
Gold refining,or parting,is used to separate gold from impurities and other metals,such as silver.Gold and silver,which are often extracted from the same ores,are chemically similar,making them difficult to separate.Before the advent of processes to separate silver and gold,a gold and silver alloy called.Cyanide Leaching Of GoldMuch thought and design goes into the making of a heap leach,to derive the best,most economical solution for recovering the gold from the ore.Once the gold has been dissolved in the cyanide,and the ore body has been reasonably depleted of its gold,there are two main processes for recovering the gold from the pregnant cyanide solution.
