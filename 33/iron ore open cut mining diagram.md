## How iron is made
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 92 94% iron and 3 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.The first and most obvious is the process of open pit mining.Huge tracts of land are stripped to bare rock.[GIFS] The 5 Stages of the Mining Life Cycle …2 天前&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Mining operations are complex.They aren't your run of the mill type projects.These billion dollar complexes consist of various interconnected projects,operating simultaneously to deliver refined commodities like gold,silver,coal and iron ore.It’s a five stage process and we’ve broken it down using GIFs.Exploration
