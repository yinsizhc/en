## Ball screw kits for Bridgeport milling machines.
Every Bridgeport mill rebuild has the option to upgrade to a Precision Ball Screw kit,but only 1 in 6 will purchase the upgrade,according to Bridgeport Machine Rebuilders.The initial cost will typically scare off a Purchasing Agent,Maintenance Manager,or Machine Shop Supervisor.But if those ball screws will last longer and be much more accurate over the life of "multiple" acme screws.Ball Screw Products Nook IndustriesBall screws assemblies offer an efficient means of converting rotary motion to linear motion.A ball screw is an improvement over an acme screw just as an antifriction ball bearing is an improvement over a plain bushing.Precision ball screws have a number of bearing balls that transfer the load between the nut and screw.
