## Leaching in Metallurgy and Metal Recovery
Lixiviant is then irrigated on top of the heap,diffused through the heap,and is eventually collected and pumped out for further processing.Usually,this method is used on low grade ores that cannot be economically processed via other means.Heap leaching is successfully used to extract gold,silver,copper,nickel,and uranium.The largest.SART for copper control in cyanide heap leachingday heap leach is used,containing 200 ppm copper cyanide and 100 ppm free cyanide,treated entirely through SART.Copper reactor Heap leach solutions are typically maintained at a pH of 9.5 11.0.Incoming solution is pumped to a tank to which sulphuric acid is.
