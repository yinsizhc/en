## Cyanide Chemistry International Cyanide Management Code.
The process of extracting gold from ore with cyanide is called cyanidation.The reaction,known as Elsner's Equation,is: 4 Au + 8 CN + O 2 + 2 H 2 O = 4 Au(CN) 2 + 4 OH Although the affinity of cyanide for gold is such that it is extracted preferentially,cyanide will also form complexes with other metals from the ore,including copper,iron.Production of Gold West Virginia UniversityUnit 100 Size Reduction of Ore The BFD of the overall process is shown in Figure 1.The PFD for Unit 100,shown in Figure 2,is designed to reduce 41.5 tons hr of gold ore from a feed range of 2 5" to 160 microns.The mined ore is fed using a Grizzly Feeder,F 101,into a Jaw Crusher,J 101,where 80% of the ore is crushed to 1.75" or.
