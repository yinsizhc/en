May 13,2019 · Efficiency can be defined by the ratio of a machine's work to the energy supplied to the machine.To apply what this means to your crusher,operations produce the exact sizes in the reduction process that their market demands.In the past,quarries produced a range of single size aggregate products up to 40 mm in size.Sieve analysis WikipediaA sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in civil engineering) to assess the particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a granular material by allowing the material to pass through a series of sieves of progressively smaller mesh size and weighing the amount of material that is stopped by each sieve as a fraction of the whole mass.

While a compression mill,such as a jaw or roll crusher,slowly applies the crushing force,an impact mill,like the cage mill or vertical shaft impactor,does so suddenly and quickly.Since energy plus material equals size reduction,the faster the speed of the crushing mechanism or the material to be crushed,the greater the potential size.crusher aggregate gradation calculationCrusher manufacturers publish grid charts,particle size cumulative distribution curves,and or product size distribution tables to help predict the gradation of the crusher product.These charts,curves,and tables give the percentages passing or retained on standard size screens for each given setting of the crusher.
