## Technology For Air Pollution Control UToledo Engineering
Some times it is possible to develop a successful air pollution control technology which leads to the problem of disposing the waste.For the control of gas borne particulate matter in industrial operations such as cement manufacture,food and beverage,mineral processing and textile industries.Dust resistivity is a measure of the.Material efficiency Concrete CentreMaterial efficiency.Concrete and masonry can offer material efficiency at each stage of development,providing varied opportunities to do more with less.Concrete is often seen as ubiquitous and low cost and so its use may not be considered as carefully as other materials that are scarce or expensive.
