## Tin Element information,properties and uses Periodic.
Tin is found principally in the ore cassiterite (tin(IV) oxide).It is mainly found in the ‘tin belt’ stretching through China,Thailand and Indonesia.It is also mined in Peru,Bolivia and Brazil.It is obtained commercially by reducing the ore with coal in a furnace.Help text not available for this section currently History.Elements and.smelting Definition & Facts Britannica.comSmelting,process by which a metal is obtained,either as the element or as a simple compound,from its ore by heating beyond the melting point,ordinarily in the presence of oxidizing agents,such as air,or reducing agents,such as coke.The first metal to be smelted in the ancient Middle East was probably copper (by 5000 bce),followed by tin,lead,and silver.

## The Properties,Production and Applications of Tin
Tin is most often produced from the mineral cassiterite,which is made up of about 80% tin.Most tin is found in alluvial deposits,riverbeds,and former riverbeds,as a result of erosion of ore bodies containing the metal.China and Indonesia are currently the world's largest producers.Tin is.Smelting chemeurope.comThe main use of smelting is to produce a metal from its ore.This includes iron extraction.The process through which the smiths learned to produce copper tin bronzes is once again a mystery.The first such bronzes were probably a lucky accident from tin contamination of copper ores,but by 2000BC we know that tin was being mined on purpose for the production of bronze.This is amazing.
