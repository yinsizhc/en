## pper ore processing dry process
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and.magnetite pper ore processing flow sheetErnest Henry Mining: Magnetite Processing.ore at full capacity.Processing Copper and gold are recovered from the ore using traditional grinding and flotation methods in the EHM concentrator.Magnetite is liberated during this process and the magnetite extraction plant allows it to be recovered from the concentrator tailings stream.
