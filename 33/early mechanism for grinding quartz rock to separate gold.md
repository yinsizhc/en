Gold mineral flotation normally adopts one stage grinding flotation process,but stages grinding and flotation for ore with uneven distribution.Grinding fineness of gold.For the gold wrapped in sulfide minerals,sulfide ore reaches monomer dissociation; but for the gold with gangue,grinding fineness should reach gold monomer dissociation.The effect of stirred mill operation on particles …Stirred milling is a grinding tool that is used extensively for mineral liberation,in order to achieve successful downstream processing such as flotation or leaching.The focus of this research is to understand the effect of different operating parameters on particle breakage mechanism.Operating parameters could be summarized as stress intensity on the particles which are varied by changing.
