## Magnetic separation Wikipedia
Magnetic Separation is the process of separating components of mixtures by using magnets to attract magnetic materials.The process that is used for magnetic separation detaches non magnetic material with those who are magnetic.This technique is useful for not all,but few minerals such as ferromagnetic (materials strongly affected by magnetic fields) and paramagnetic (materials that are less.Enlighten Biomagnetic Separation ProcessesHowever,most researchers and developers focus only on the magnetic beads or particles to optimize their separation process.The effectivity of the biomagnetic separation depending on the magnetic carrier is only half of the story.To have the complete picture we also need to pay attention to the role of the applied magnetic field on the play.

## Separation Techniques Classification of Matter
A separation process or technique is a method that converts a mixture or solution of chemical substances into two or more distinct product mixtures.At least one of results of the separation is enriched in one or more of the source mixture's constituents.In some cases,a separation may fully divide the mixture into pure constituents.Magnetic separation of a mixture of iron filings and sandmixture when it will pick the magnetic substance out of the mixture (see Figure 1).Magnetic impurities are removed from their ores by the use of magnetic separation.This can also be applied in the laboratory,e.g.to a mixture of iron filings and sulphur.Fig.1.Separating a mixture of iron filings and sand using a magnetic bar Equipment.
