## AGGREGATE ABRASION VALUE (AAV) GEOTECHNICAL
The Abrasion Machine is used to determine the Aggregate Abrasion Value (AAV) by testing the measure of the resistance of aggregates to surface wear by abrasion.The Abrasion Machine consists of a flat circular cast iron grinding lap wheel of 600 mm dia.which rotates in.Los Angeles AbrasionThe percentage wear of the aggregates due to rubbing action with steel balls is determined and is known as the Los Angeles abrasion value.However,it should be noted that the steel balls also cause an impact on aggregates.Abrasion testing of aggregate is one of more direct application to the testing of stone aggregate for wearing.
