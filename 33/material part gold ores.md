## How to Identify a Gold Bearing Area Sciencing
Research the geological properties of a particular gold bearing area of interest.These properties include the rock formations,structure,fault lines and the primary mineral content of the area.Also,study the mineralization process of gold in general to determine which segment of a particular area may yield gold.(See Reference 1.)Mineral ResourcesGold prices vary on a daily basis.When gold prices are high,old abandoned mines re open,when the price drops,gold mines close.The cost of labor is currently so high in the U.S.that few gold mines can operate profitably,but in third world countries where labor costs are lower,gold mines that have ore concentrations well below those found in the U.S.can operate with a profit.
