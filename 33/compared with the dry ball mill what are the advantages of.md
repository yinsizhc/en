I'm dealing with uranium ores in a lab scale ball mill (Bond Ball Mill).Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball millswith an ability to dry,grind and classify within a single unit gives the vertical roller mill a decided advantage over a ball mill system.However,despite these benefits,applications of the vertical roller mill for cement grinding are less prevalent.The two compartment ball mill operating in a closed circuit with a high efficiency separator.
