## Acid mine drainage microbewiki
Acid mine drainage (AMD) occurs when metal sulfides,most commonly pyrite,are exposed to and react with air and water.When water flows over or through sulfur bearing mine tailings,a chemical reaction occurs between the water and rocks resulting in metal rich water.Heavy metals content in acid mine drainage at. AIP PublishingThe concentration of heavy metals in the AMD appeared to be influenced by.oxidation of sulphides particularly iron pyrite is the main source of acid mine.is also affected by naturally occurring catalysts,which play an important role in.
