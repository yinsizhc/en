## Banded Iron Formation an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Banded Iron Formation.Banded iron formation or BIF is a chemical sediment,typically thin bedded or laminated with >15% iron of sedimentary origin.BIF has a very distinct distribution with time (see Figure 9.32 in Chapter 9).It is found in minor amounts in the early Archean and in large amounts in the late Archean,appears again around 1.9.1.Lutsinge B 2.Muravha E 3.Moswathupa HAlgoma type banded iron formations Algoma type BIFs are associated with volcanic arcs and are typically found in Archean greenstone belts.Lake Superior type banded iron formations The majority of Lake Superior,or simply Superior,type BIFs are located on stable continental platforms and were mainly deposited in Paleoproterozoic times.

The Lake Superior region was a warm ocean basin,and in the deep,calm areas of the ocean,this alternating sedimentation occurred.Most believe this was from cyanobacteria that used Fe+ in the water as a metabolic aid,which was later expelled with oxygen,to create the iron oxide bands.Banded iron formation Types and Facts MonumentsThe types of Banded iron formation include Algoma type,Lake Superior type,Superior type and Taconite.Depending upon Banded iron formation Texture,it is divided into types.Here,you will get to know about Banded iron formation types,interesting facts,features of Banded iron formation,its monuments and fossils.

A field trip to the Lake Superior type deposits in the Marquette and Gogebic iron districts of Michigan has provided a thorough rock sampling of the different facies,including several types of crystalline,gray hematite.Micaceous,specular hematite with a schistose texture is highly metamorphosed and is probably not seen on the surface of Mars.The Penokean orogeny in the Lake Superior region USGSSynchronous extension and subsidence of the Superior craton resulted in a broad shallow sea characterized by volcanic grabens (Menominee Group in northern Michigan).The classic Lake Superior banded ironformations,including those in the Marquette,Gogebic,Mesabi and Gunflint Iron Ranges,formed in that sea.
