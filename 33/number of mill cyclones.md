## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().Formula For Recirculating Load Of Cyclones And MillFormula For Recirculating Load Of Cyclones And Mill Prompt : Caesar is a famous mining equipment manufacturer well known both at home and abroad,major in producing stone crushing equipment,mineral separation equipment,limestone grinding equipment,etc.
