## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.
Sulfide ores are generally processed using pyrometallurgy,the extraction and purification of metals by processes involving the application of heat.This process uses a series of physical steps and high temperatures to extract and purify copper from copper sulfide ores,in four basic steps: 1) froth flotation,2) thickening,3) smelting,and 4.Sulphide Gold Ore Treatment by Leaching and Flotation202054&ensp&#0183&enspThere are many arrangements and combinations using flotation in conjunction with treatment of gold ores.The two gold process flowsheets shown,with some variations,are probably the most commonly used.In Gold Flowsheet No.1 the ore is ground in water to such a size as to free the minerals sufficiently to produce a tailing by flotation low enough in value that it may be discarded.
