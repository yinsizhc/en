## FUNDAMENTAL SURFACE CHEMISTRY AND FROTH.
Two ore types,copper and fluorite,were researched.The primary gangue mineral of interest was calcite for the fluorite ore,while it was pyrite for the copper ore.Surface chemistry studies including zeta potential,adsorption density,and.ATO also demonstrated a positive effect on the grade and recovery of the Peruvian copper ore.Copper Sulfide Ore Flotation Technologies XinhaiCopper sulfide ore has good inherent floatability,so flotation process is a mature method used for copper sulfide ore separation.In recent years,with the continuous development of copper sulphide flotation technology,many scholars also proposed a series of new principles of mineral processing,such as “collect early,loss early” and “more crushing and less grinding”.

## Tailings Wikipedia
Tailings are the materials left over after the process of separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore.Tailings are distinct from overburden,which is the waste rock or other material that overlies an ore or mineral body and is displaced during mining without being processed.The extraction of minerals from ore can be done two ways: placer mining,which uses water.Chapter 6 Copper Production Technology1996 11 20&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Chapter 6 Copper Production Technology.2 Hydrometallurgy is the recovery of metaIs from ores using water based solutions.As early as 6000 B.C.native copper the pure.mixture of copper ore,charcoal and iron ore to act as a flux.It was blown for several hours by foot or hand bellows.

## Copper Mining and Processing: Everything you Need to Know
The Basics of Copper Mining and Processing.Mined from open pits,copper ore must be crushed as part of the process that occurs between extraction and production.Using today's compact mining equipment,copper ore is extracted from the mine.After the ore is crushed,it's roasted,which helps to convert sulfides to oxides.GOLD AND SILVERThe extracted ore must be mill ed to prepare it for further recovery activities.Uniformly sized particles may be obtained by crushing,grinding,and wet or dry classification.The degree of milling performed on the ore depends on the gold concentration of the ore,mineralogy and hardness of the ore,the mill's capacity,and the next planned.
