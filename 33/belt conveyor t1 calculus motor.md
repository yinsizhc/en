## Belt Conveyors for Bulk Materials Fifth Edition Chapter 6
The effect of acceleration of the belt conveyor when starting from rest must be considered,as the tension in the belt at point c will be increased over the running ten sion T c.To prevent the belt from lifting from the idlers during acceleration at the start up,it is necessary to calculate the acceleration forces and determine the total belt.Automotion® Conveyors and SystemsAutomotion's AutoRoll motor driven roller (MDR) conveyor is quiet,safe,low maintenance and offers non contact zero pressure accumulation.AutoRoll conveyor features "run on demand" zones,reducing energy consumption and noise.
