## Seeking a Safer Future for Electricity's Coal Ash Waste
People don't usually see the ash left over from the electricity that's burned when they turn on their lights or run their air conditioners.But at coal power plants,fly ash builds up every day.Bottom ash SourceWatch{{#badges:CoalSwarm}} Bottom ash is one kind of waste produced by coal fired power plants in the coal combustion process.Along with fly ash,which is captured by pollution control equipment from coal plant chimneys,it is often referred to simply as coal ash.Coal bottom ash is a coarse,granular byproduct of coal combustion that is collected from the bottom of coal furnaces in power plants.

## Civil Engineering: Fly ash from thermal power plants.
Disposal and management of fly ash is a major problem in coal fired thermal power plants.Fly ash emissions from a variety of coal combustion units show a wide range of composition.All elements below atomic number 92 are present in coal ash.A 500 MW thermal power plant releases 200 mt SO 2,70 t NO 2 and 500 t fly ash approximately every day.Madhya Pradesh coal plant fined over fly ash india news.On August 7,cracks developed in a fly ash dyke of the 1,200 MW coal based thermal power plant near village Bandhaura.The fly ash leaked from the dyke reportedly turned into mudslide and affected.
