## What is Coking Coal
Coking coal,also known as metallurgical coal,is used to create coke,one of the key irreplaceable inputs for the production of steel.There are many varieties of coal in the world,ranging from brown coal or lignite to anthracite.The property that really sets coking coals apart from other coals is its caking ability,which is the specific.Coking Coal CRM AllianceOne of the highest grades of coal is metallurgical coal or coking coal.It forms one of the key inputs required for the production of steel (mainly used in iron and steel making industries).70% of the steel produced today uses coal.In 2010,world crude steel production was 1.4 billion tonnes,requiring 721 million tonnes of coking coal.
