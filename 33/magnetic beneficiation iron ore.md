## Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation ispatguru
Magnetic Separation and Iron Ore Beneficiation Magnetic separation is an old technique for the concentration of iron ores and for the removal of tramp iron Since 1849,a number of patents on magnetic separation have been issued in USA,and texts of some of the patents before 1910 describe a variety of magnetic separators for mineral processingIron Ore Beneficiation SRK NewsIron ores come in come in many shapes and sizes (and mineralogies),so there is no one size fits all approach to beneficiation.For magnetite ores,it is typically necessary to liberate the individual magnetite grains from the host rocks,after which beneficiation is relatively straightforward due to the magnetic properties of magnetite.
