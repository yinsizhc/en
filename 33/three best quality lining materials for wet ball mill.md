## Manufacture of Portland Cement Process and Material use
The action of ball mill is very simple.The material to be ground is fed from the top.When the mill is rotate about its horizontal axis,the steel balls strike against the perforate curve plates and in doing so,they crush the materials.This crush material passes through an inner sieve plate and then through an outer sieve plate.Tubular Ball Mills7.3.Operation of Tubular Ball Mills.Tubular ball mills ride on steel tyres or are supported at both ends by trunnions.Girth gears bolted to the shell drive the mill through a pinion shaft from a prime mover drive.The prime movers are usually synchronous motors that operate through an air clutch or gear system.
