## Ball Mills Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
The ore from the crushing section is delivered to the fine ore bin placed at the head of the grinding section,from which it is fed,together with water,to one or more grinding units consisting of a ball mill or rod mill in circuit with a classifier.One such unit with a conical ball mill is shown in Fig.9.A ball mill consists essentially of a conical or cylindrical shell supported on.Key considerations when selecting a mill lining systemSAG mills generate higher levels of impact reduction and ball mills higher levels of abrading action.A mill lining system serves two purposes: to protect the mill shell from wear caused by the impact and abrasion of the mill charge,and to elevate and tumble the mill contents in the necessary manner to create a grinding action.To achieve this.
