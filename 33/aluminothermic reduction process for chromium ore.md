The geologic sources of chromium are essentially mixtures of spinels of the ideal form RO·R 2 O 3 (e.g.chromite is FeO·Cr 2 O 3),although a more accurate representation of an ore source would be (Mg,Fe)Cr 2 O 4 with silica and alumina gangue materials.The refining processes for chromium metal have been thermodynamically defined by their spinel origins.Synthesis of Copper Chromium Alloys by Alumninothermic Reductionprocesses are required to obtain an uniformly distribution of Chromium particles in the Copper matrix.The synthesis of copper chromium alloys by a cost reduced aluminothermic reduction process is.refractory metal oxides or ores.
