## Concretion Wikipedia
A concretion is a hard,compact mass of matter formed by the precipitation of mineral cement within the spaces between particles,and is found in sedimentary rock or soil.Concretions are often ovoid or spherical in shape,although irregular shapes also occur.The word 'concretion' is derived from the Latin con meaning 'together' and crescere meaning 'to grow'.Oil & Gas Are Found in What Kind of Rocks? SciencingThe types of rocks that contain oil and natural gas are all sedimentary rocks,rocks formed when grains and mineral particles deposited by running water fuse together.Because these rocks are cemented together from such small components,they are porous,full of spaces in which energy rich carbon compounds can settle.
