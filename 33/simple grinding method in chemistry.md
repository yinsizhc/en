## Preparation of Chitin Nanofibers from Squid Pen β Chitin.
A procedure for preparing individualized chitin nanofibers 3−4 nm in cross sectional width and at least a few microns in length was developed.The key factors to prepare the chitin nanofibers with such high aspect ratios are as follows: (1) squid pen β chitin is used as the starting material and (2) ultrasonication of the β chitin in water at pH 3−4 and 0.1−0.3% consistency for a few.A facile preparation method for nanosized MOFs as a …This simple grinding method afforded a nanosized,multifunctional biomaterial that was used for cell imaging and drug delivery,and it can be extended to other MOFs to widen their applications.Keywords: Metal organic framework,nanoparticles,bioimaging,drug delivery,endocytosis
