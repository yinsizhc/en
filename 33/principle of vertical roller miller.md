## Principle and Working of MILLING. Engineering Tutorials
 · Introduction: Milling is the cutting operation that removes metal by feeding the work against a rotating,cutter having single or multiple cutting edges.Flat or curved surfaces of many shapes can be machined by milling with good finish and accuracy.A milling machine may also be used for drilling,slotting,making a circular profile and gear cutting by having suitable attachments.FUNdaMENTALS of Design MITprinciples as you read about bearings! The principle of reciprocity is particularly useful in the design of bearing systems: Whenever you think you have a good design,invert it,think of using a com pletely different type of bearing or mounting,and com pare it to what you originally considered.Why did some civilizations discover bearings and
