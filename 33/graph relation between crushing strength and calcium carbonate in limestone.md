## Calcium carbonate Wikipedia
Calcium carbonate is a chemical compound with the formula Ca CO 3.It is a common substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and aragonite (most notably as limestone,which is a type of sedimentary rock consisting mainly of calcite) and is the main component of pearls and the shells of marine organisms,snails,and eggs.Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and.Study on the mechanical strength of primary carbonateThe mechanical strength of three carbonate tablets constructed by uniaxial compaction is evaluated using a simple tester,specially designed,as a comparative method,to classify and establish correlations between the measured resistance and the physical and flow properties of each carbonate.
