## Magnetically labeled feeder system for mouse pluripotent
We report here a magnetically labeled feeder system for mouse embryonic stem induced pluripotent stem (ES iPS) cells.Magnetic attraction of feeder cells labeled with magnetite nanoparticles significantly increased ES iPS colonyforming efficiency.Magnetic labeling of feeder cells also facilitated separation of ES iPS cells from feeder cells.Magnetic Separators For Mineral Process Bunting RedditchMagnetic separators can be found in most mineral processing operations,especially those processing non metallic minerals and magnetic ores.This article investigates the use of high intensity magnetic separators and magnetic separation equipment in the minerals sector with a focus on processing dry materials (in the 15mm,+45 micron size range).
