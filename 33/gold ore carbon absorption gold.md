## Gold Absorption Carbon Genuine Shell Carb Pvt Ltd
Carbon is added in leach so that the gold is adsorbed onto carbon almost as soon as it is dissolved by the cyanide solution.The CIL process is frequently used when native carbon is present in the gold ore.This native carbon will absorb the leached gold and prevent its recovery.This phenomenon is referred to commonly as "pregrobbing".Recovery of cyanide in gold leach waste solution by.In this study,the effects of pH,time and temperature in regeneration of cyanide in the leaching waste solution of gold production from disseminated gold ore by cyanidation process were investigated and the optimum conditions,consumptions and cyanide recovery values were determined.
