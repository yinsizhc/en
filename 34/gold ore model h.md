## On the source of orogenic gold Geology …
Gold has historically been a key strategic commodity,and the study of gold deposit formation has long been investigated.Debate on the genesis of so called “orogenic gold deposits” (&gt;75% of gold recovered through history; Phillips,2013),continues largely because it is difficult to reliably identify the source of gold.In this issue of Geology,Gaboury.Quartz Pebble Conglomerate Gold Depositstory.Because the gold ore in the Witwatersrand Basin is located in ore “reefs,” these deposits have also been coined quartz pebble reef deposits.The almond shape of the quartz pebbles has also led these deposits to be referred to as banket type (in Dutch,banket refers to a type of almond pastry).More

## Gold: Mineral information,data and localities.
Gold is one of the first minerals used by prehistoric cultures.The Latin name for this mineral was "aurum" and Jöns Jakob Berzelius used Au to represent the element when he established the current system of chemical symbols.The Old English word "gold" first appeared in written form about 725 and may further have been derived from "gehl" or.Gold bearing reefs of the Witwatersrand Basin: A model of.The current concepts concerning the genesis of the unique ore bearing reefs of the Witwatersrand Basin and its gold resource potential are considered.The results of microscopic examination of ore from the Black,Ventersdorp Contact,Carbon Leader,and Vaal reefs,as well as of thermobarometric study of quartz,are presented.

The specific model(s) for gold ore genesis remains controversial.Although the direct syngenetic models of the 1970s are no longer applicable,the gold itself may be initially added into the volcanic and sedimentary crustal rock sequences,probably within marine pyrite,during seafloor hydrothermal events.R&H Proucts Home Page R&H ProductsR&H Products is proud to offer the finest quality speed files in existence today.With state of the art components,such as,hardened spring steel clips,heavy aluminum base plates & thick rubber pads assure lasting performance for the lifetime of these durable tools.A thicker rubber pad gives a comfortable cushion base for ease and accuracy.
