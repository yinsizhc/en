## Consumption of steel grinding media in mills A review.
In highly abrasive ores,approximately 1 2 kg of grinding media can be consumed per ton of ore milled (Moema et al.2009).In wet milling,this assumes proper pulp coverage of the ball surfaces,i.e.not too thick to cushion the impact between balls and not too dilute to result in insufficient coverage of ball surfaces and excessive ball wear.Crushing in Mineral ProcessingIn mineral processing or metallurgy,the first stage of comminution is crushing.Depending of the type of rock (geometallurgy) to be crushed,there are 2 largely different techniques at your disposition for crushing rocks.In principle,compression crushing is used on hard and abrasive rocks by placing them between a high wear resistant plate surface.Less abrasive and softer rocks or stones.

Some characteristics of the ore determine the grindability of the ore.The grindability of the ore determines the difficulty of grinding,and the grinding degree is high.The difficulty of the mine is relatively large.The ore will wear a lot of Pearl Shell Grinding Machine liners and steel balls,and the energy consumed will naturally be more.Consumption of steel grinding media in mills A …Consumption of grinding media in mills is an economically important problem.In highly abrasive ores,approximately 1 2 kg of grinding media can be consumed per ton of ore milled (Moema et al.2009).In wet milling,this assumes proper pulp coverage of the ball surfaces,i.e.not too thick to cushion the impact between balls and not too.
