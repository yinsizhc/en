## DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) Production Solutions.
DRI (Direct Reduced Iron) Production Solutions.Solution A Tunnel Kiln Direct Reduction.By using tunnel kiln to produce DRI is that mix the iron ore concentrate,pulverized coal and limestone powder with certain proportion and feed into material drum for being reduction,and then put these drums on the kiln car and pushed it into the tunnel kiln,when the material drum is heated to 1150.Direct Reduced Iron Industrial Efficiency Technology.Direct Reduced Iron (DRI),also known as Sponge Iron,offers an alternative steel production route to BF BOF and Scrap EAF routes.In DRI,iron ore is reduced in its solid state unlike BF process where a liquid metal is formed during reduction.DRI can then be transformed to steel in electric arc furnaces.DRI production is common in Middle East,South America,India and Mexico.

This turns the kiln very slowly,but enough to prevent damage Internal heat exchangers Heat exchange in a rotary kiln may be by conduction,convection and radiation,in descending order of efficiency In low temperature processes,and in the cooler parts of long kilns lacking preheaters,the kiln is often furnished with internal heat.SPONGE IRON PLANTMost solid reduction process use non coking coal as reducing agent due to abundantly available non coking coal The process proposed to be adopted is the rotary kiln proposes using Non coking coal and iron ore Iron are undergoes the following reduction reaction in all the processes Fe2o3 + 2 CO = 2 Fe + 3 Co2
