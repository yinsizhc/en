## Model rock blasting—effect of explosives properties …
Some of this work is described in references [ 1 17].However,the very important practical problem of relating explosives properties and other variables to blasting results,particularly to fragmentation obtained in blasting with two free faces using columnar charges,as in slabbing or bench blasting,has remained relatively obscure.Control of fines through blasting design at a limestone.The re sults of this study agree well with the work of La Pointe and Ganow [4].CONTROL OF FINES THROUGH BLASTING DESIGN 177 Conclusion From the blasting experiments at Lambid har limestone quarry it may be concluded that the recommended pattern of blasting would help minimize the production of fines.

## CDC Mining Topic Blasting and Explosives NIOSH
Apr 04,2017 · What is the health and safety problem? Detonating explosives release toxic gases,primarily oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide.Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO 2) are produced by large surface blasts in which the explosive does not detonate properly.NO released by the detonation oxidizes to NO 2 as the fumes mix with the atmosphere.Excessive NO 2 production is.drilling and blasting cost Mining and BlastingMay 19,2011 · The recent increase in ammonium nitrate and diesel oil prices have invited many operations in mine to re examine their drilling and blasting methods to find ways of reducing costs.Under the changed scenario,drilling and blasting companies require to optimize their blasting and costs through a blasting optimization review.
