## Zinc mining Wikipedia
Zinc mining is the process by which mineral forms of the metal zinc are extracted from the earth through mining.A zinc mine is a mine that produces zinc minerals in ore as its primary product.Common co products in zinc ores include minerals of lead and silver.Other mines may produce zinc minerals as a by product of the production of ores containing more valuable minerals or metals,such as.Mining NewsTORONTO,Sept.26,2019 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) Nevada Zinc Corporation (“Nevada Zinc” or the “Company”) (TSX V: NZN) announces the filing on SEDAR of its independent Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) of the viability of potentially mining the zinc mineralization at the Company’s 100% owned Lone Mountain Project (“Project”) in central Nevada.
