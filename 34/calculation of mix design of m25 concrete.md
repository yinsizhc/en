## What is the maximum cement quantity for m25 grade concrete,
Nov 04,2020&#0183;&#32;Answer by Mihir Salanke: Mix proportion for M25 grade of concrete is 1:1:2(cement:fine aggregates:coarse aggregates) So if you need 4cum of M25 concrete,we need to have 1cum of cement So,theoretically,for 1cum of M25 concrete,we need to have 025cum of cement But in practice,whenever we estimate quantity of cement for concrete,What is Water Cement Ratio? Guide & Calculation CivilologyWater Cement Ratio means the ratio between the weight of water to the weight of cement used in concrete mix.Normally water cement ratio falls under 0.4 to 0.6 as per IS Code 10262 (2009) for nominal mix (M10,M15.M25) We all know that water cement ratio will directly affect the strength of concrete.
