## Thickener Feed System Design WesTech Engineering
Jun 14,2016 Gravity thickeners concentrate suspended solids in minerals slurries.These slurries typically are introduced at the center of the tanks and allowed to thicken to the desired density.A key component of any thickener is the feedwell,which has the following functions: • Control energy and momentumConventional Thickeners Solid Liquid SeparationConventional Thickeners are generally incorporated in heavy duty applications when the underflow density is high and substantial torques are required to convey the settled solids from the periphery to the central outlet for pumping away.Likewise,thickeners are often used for storage to facilitate the continuous feeding of downstream filters.
