## What is an ultrafine grinding mill?
Utrafine grinding mill usually means the grinding mill can grind the material to ultra fine powder.In mining industry,there are many types of ultra fine grinding mill like Raymond mill,HGM micro powProduction of polymer particles below 5 μm by wet grinding.It is shown that wet grinding of polymers in a stirred media mill and organic solvents (ethanol,hexane) at reduced temperatures down to − 80 °C is a suitable method to produce polymer particles of mean diameter smaller than 5 μm with narrow particle size distribution.

mean particle size (in microns or &#181;) is commonly referred to as the “average” or the “micron size”.Another common calculation performed in the size analysis procedure is to determine the “log normal standard deviation”.For most feed mateThe Effects of Diet Particle Size on Animal Performance.However,the largest response was observed by reducing particle size from 1,200 to 600 microns (9 percent increase in litter weight gain).Surprisingly,feed intake actually increased (linear,P less than.05) as particle size was reduced suggesting finely ground feed does not decrease palatability of the diet.
