## Ball Milling
Wet circuit: the feed material is fed into the mill with water or in the form of a pulp.Dry circuit: this type of grinding requires a predrying step for the feed material,but it reduces the subsequent steps associated with handing wet material,such as thickening,homogenization,and filtering.Preparation of graphene by exfoliation of graphite using.Wet ball milling was used to exfoliate graphite platelets into graphenes in a liquid medium.Multi layered graphite nanosheets with a thickness of 30 to 80 nm were dispersed into N,N dimethylformamide (DMF) and exfoliated by shear force dominated ball milling carried out in a planetary mill.After high speed centrifugation,irregular shaped single and few layer graphene sheets (≤3 layers.
