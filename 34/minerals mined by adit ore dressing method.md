In mines where wolframite was mixed with cassiterite,such as South Crofty and East Pool mine in Cornwall or with bismuth such as at the Shepherd and Murphy mine in Moina,Tasmania,magnetic separation was used to separate the ores.At these mines a device called a Wetherill's Magnetic Separator (invented by John Price Wetherill,1844 1906)[1.4 Uranium Mining,Processing,and Reclamation Uranium.URANIUM MINING METHODS.Based on the current understanding of uranium deposits in the Commonwealth of Virginia,extraction of uranium ore would use open pit mining,or underground mining,or a combination of both ().These general terms incorporate a large variety of design possibilities—there are as many methods of mining uranium as there are orebody sizes,shapes,and mineral …

## Mining Waste an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Jadwiga Szczepańska,Irena Twardowska,in Waste Management Series,2004.III.6.1.1 Mining waste sources and amounts.Mining waste is the high volume material that originates from the processes of excavation,dressing and further physical and chemical processing of wide range of metalliferous and non metalliferous minerals by opencast and deep shaft methods.What are the main methods of mining? American.There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.
