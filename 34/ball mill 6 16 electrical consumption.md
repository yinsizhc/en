## Charge behaviour and power consumption in ball mills.
The specific power consumption for these two ball shapes is shown in Fig.16.For N≤75% there is no change in the mill power draw.This occurs because the center of mass of the charge is little changed by theAMIT 135: Lesson 6 Grinding Circuit Mining Mill Operator.Scale up criterion is the net specific power consumption,i.e.the power consumed by the mill rotor itself minus all mechanical and electrical losses divided by the feed rate of solids.For the full scale m
