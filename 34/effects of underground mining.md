## Environmental Risks of Mining
Mining is an inherently invasive process that can cause damage to a landscape in an area much larger than the mining site itself.The effects of this damage can continue years after a mine has shut down,including the addition to greenhouse gasses,death of flora and fauna,and erosion of land and habitat.Underground mining has severe environmental impacts.While underground mining initially disturbs only a small portion of the surface above a mined area,long‐term effects from ground subsidence can be more severe and widespread than the effects from modern strip mining and reclamation.
