## Iron rich sedimentary rocks Wikipedia
Iron rich sedimentary rocks are sedimentary rocks which contain 15% or more iron.However,most sedimentary rocks contain iron in varying degrees.The majority of these rocks were deposited during specific geologic time periods: The Precambrian (3800 to 570 million years ago),the early Paleozoic (570 to 410 million years ago),and the middle to late Mesozoic (205 to 66 million years ago).26 U.S.Code § 613 Percentage depletion U.S.Code US.Pub.L.87 312,Sept.26,1961,75 Stat.674,provided for the election of,and procedure for,a differing rate of depletion for clay and shale used in the manufacture of clay products,such election to be effective for all taxable years beginning before Jan.1,1961,in respect of which the assessment of a deficiency,a refund or credit of.
