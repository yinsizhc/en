## Palladium Mining,Techniques,Mines,Occurence,…
Palladium is normally a platinum group Metal (PGM).It is a rare element and occurs along with deposits of platinum,nickel,copper,silver and gold and is therefore obtained as a byproduct of mining these metals i.e.PGM.The mining of palladium is a very intricate process because of the fact that palladium is so spread out under the surface and in the mines and requires using mechanical.ore National Geographic SocietyOre genesis,the process by which a deposit of ore is created,is estimated to take millions of years.There are three major types of ore genesis: internal processes,hydrothermal processes,and surficial processes.Ore can accumulate through geologic activity,such as when volcanoes bring ore from deep in the planet to the surface.This is.

Another process involves ground ore being passed over plates which are coated with mercury.The gold and the mercury form an amalgam,leading to the name of the process,amalgamation.Once the amalgam has formed,it is heated until the mercury gas is boiled off,leaving the gold.The mercury gas is highly toxic and must be handled carefully.The Silver Extraction Process2018 1 17&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Silver Extraction Process.The ore used to extract silver was not a silver ore but Lead Sulphide (formula PbS),known as Galena or Galenite (named by the Roman Pliny) which contains 87% lead.Removing the ore &amp; carrying it out of the mine.Carrying the ore to the horse drawn cart.Transporting the ore to the pounding area.
