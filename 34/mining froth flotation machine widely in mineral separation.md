## Froth flotation Camborne School of Mines,University of.
Froth flotation facilities.Froth flotation utilises differences in the surface chemistry of particles to separate minerals.Froth flotation is widely used in mineral processing.Its primary application is for the concentration of sulphide minerals such as chalcopyrite (copper),sphalerite (zinc) and galena (lead).Mining pedia Mineral Extraction,Mineral Processing.Froth flotation is the use of the physical and chemical properties of the surface of the ore,the use of chemical separation of useful ore.In the process of froth flotation,useful minerals are separated by floating them in the foams,and the way of keeping gangue minerals in the pulp is called positive flotation,while the way of floating.
