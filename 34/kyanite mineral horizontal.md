## Kyanite Metaphysical Properties & Design Uses
Kyanite is strongly anisotropic it has a dual Mohs hardness depending on the angle the pressure comes from.In fact,it is the most commonly known anisotropic mineral! Its vertical hardness ranges from 4.5 to 5.5; its horizontal hardness ranges from 6 to 7.APUS CLE : SCIN138 2018 : Week 2 Forum.pdf Topic.On the Mohs scale its vertical hardness is somewhere in the area of 4.5 to 5.5,but its horizontal hardness ranges from 6 to 7 on the Mohs scale.(King,2015) It's said to take a very skilled cutter to cut this mineral correctly.Kyanite is found all over the world in places such as Austria,Burma,Brazil.
