## LEARNING CNC STRATERGIES AND TIPS: trochoidal milling
May 28,2014 · Trochoidal machining is therefore appropriate to use in high speed machining (HSM) as the cutting tool always moves along a curve with a constant radius and this also makes it possible to maintain a relatively consistent feed rate throughout the machining process.Tooling Tips for High speed MachiningSuccessful high speed milling requires a balance among every aspect of the cutting system,including the machine tool,software,chip removal,and cutting tool.Photo courtesy of Seco.High speed machining (HSM) shaves time off metal removal processes.Low speeds and feeds that remove a large amount of material are replaced with light depths of.

## High Speed Machining
The concept of high speed machining (HSM) was first introduced by C.Salomon back in the 1930s.Through a series of tests done by Salomon,it was found that the cutting temperature reaches its maximum value at a certain cutting speed,and with a further increase of the cutting speed,machining temperatures start to drop,as shown in Figure 1 (1).Six Flute High Performance End MillsT Carb&#174; Flute High Performance End Mills are ideal for aggressive high speed machining using Trochoidal and Peel Milling techniques.The additional flutes allow higher feed rates at reduced tool loads,ultimately preventing breakage and failure.The variable
