## The Making of Iron & Steel
Iron ore,as mined,is a combination of iron with oxygen and various other unwanted substances,generally known as "gangue".The first metallurgical step is to reduce iron ore to metallic iron,a process which is mostly carried out in a blast furnace,using coke as both a fuel and reducing agent.Steelmaking WikipediaIn HIsarna ironmaking process,iron ore is processed almost directly into liquid iron or hot metal.The process is based around a type of blast furnace called a cyclone converter furnace,which makes it possible to skip the process of manufacturing pig iron pellets that is necessary for the basic oxygen steelmaking process.
