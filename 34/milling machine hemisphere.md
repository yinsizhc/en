## Introduction to the Lathe as a Milling Machine ~ AxiBook
All milling involves a continuous sequence of shock loads,and the lathe is not designed to withstand these.Even a small milling machine will have some 20 to 25 sq.ins.of slide way bearing surface,whereas it is a good 3 Inch lathe which provides 10 sq.ins.on the saddle,with less on the cross slide.Generating spherical surfaces Cutting Tool Engineering2020 2 27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;A unique manual milling method is available for generating geometrically true spherical surfaces.This technique can be used to machine convex and concave spherical surfaces.Other than the milling machine,the only tools needed are a boring head and a rotary table.If you have a CNC lathe or mill,this is really just an academic exercise.
