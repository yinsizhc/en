When the mill is rotated without feed or with very fine feed,the rods are in parallel alignment and in contact with one another for their full length.New feed entering at one end of the mill causes the rod charge to spread at that end.This produces a series of wedge shaped slots tapering toward the discharge end.The tumbling and rolling rods expend most of their crushing force on the.Gunsmithing Tools Jigs & Fixtures Pacific Tool and GaugeGunsmithing Tools Jigs at Pacific Tool and Gauge.Store Information.Pacific Tool & Gauge 675 Antelope Rd,White City,OR 97503

A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.Tungsten Extraction Process Mineral Processing & MetallurgyThe cleaner jig tailings return by gravity to join the rod mill discharge and are returned to the rougher jig.The final jig concentrate is,on an average,made up of 77% scheelite,8% ferberite,4% hematite and 11% silicates and oxides.The specific gravity is 5.73.The mesh analysis of the final jig.

## What's the Difference Between Ball Mills and Rod Mills.
Discharge method.The rod mill adopts overflow type and open type discharge,does not use grate type discharge.The diameter of the rod mill discharge end is larger than that of the same size ball mill.When the rod mill speed is lower than the working speed of the same size ball mill,the medium in the rod mill is in a sloping working state.Ball Mills vs Rod MillsThe average particle is subjected to an action similar to many sets of rolls in series,before it is discharged.Because of this,the rod mill can effectively reduce 1″ feed size to 10 mesh or finer in open circuit.The voids (or interstitial space) within a rod load are approximately half those in a ball mill.
