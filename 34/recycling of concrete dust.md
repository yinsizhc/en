## RECYCLING OF WASTE CONCRETE
Recycling of waste concrete is done to reuse the concrete rubble as aggregates in concrete.The recycled concrete aggregates have less crushing strength,impact resistance,specific gravity and has more absorption value as compared to fresh aggregates.MIT students fortify concrete by adding recycled plastic. · The concrete with fly ash or silica fume was stronger than concrete made with just Portland cement.And the presence of irradiated plastic along with fly ash strengthened the concrete even further,increasing its strength by up to 15 percent compared with samples made just with Portland cement,particularly in samples with high dose irradiated.
