## Understanding FCC feeds and benefits to refinery operation
To assure applicability to industrial processes,the following refinery streams,which are frequently part of the riser feed blend,were included in this study: atmospheric and vacuum gas oil,light and heavy coker gas oil,hydrocracked residue,atmospheric residue,and deasphalted oil.Ball Mill FeedersThe entire mill feed enters the drum via a chute or spout and an internal spiral carries the feed into the trunnion liner.The drum feeder may be used in lieu of a spout feeder when headroom limits direct spouting.The drum also provides a convenient method of adding grinding balls to a ball mill.The drum is generally lined with Manganese Steel.
