## Sintering Hematite Iron Ore
The authors investigate the influence of the basicity index CaO SiO2 on the sintering properties of hematite ore mixtures.The experimentation was performed with three different mixtures of ores from Tazadit,Nimba,Mano River,Itabira,Marcona,Goa,Mapawa and Cassinga.Iron Geoscience AustraliaIn the Earth's crust iron is found mainly as minerals of iron oxide such as hematite,magnetite,goethite and limonite.The minerals that are mostly used as ore for making iron are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).Iron is quite soft and easily worked,but it has a very high melting point of 1538°C.

## Limonite Wikipedia
While the first iron ore was likely meteoric iron,and hematite was far easier to smelt,in Africa,where the first evidence of iron metallurgy occurs,limonite is the most prevalent iron ore.Before smelting,as the ore was heated and the water driven off,more and more of the limonite was converted to hematite.How the Iron Ore Market Works (VALE,RIO)Iron ore is a mineral that is rich in iron and oxide.It is found in rocks and minerals in any of several forms,including magnetite,hematite,geothite,limonite and siderite.Metallic iron is.
