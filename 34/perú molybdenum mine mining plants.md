## Molybdenum processing Britannica
Molybdenum processing,preparation of the ore for use in various products.Molybdenum (Mo) is a white platinum like metal with a melting point of 2,610 °C (4,730 °F).In its pure state,it is tough and ductile and is characterized by moderate hardness,high thermal conductivity,high resistance to corrosion,and a low expansion coefficient.These 10 mines will set the copper price for the next.The mine operates as an open pit but underground construction began in late 2011 which will access 1.7Bt of reserves grading 0.7% copper and 502ppm molybdenum (approximately 40 years of mine life.
