## Your Guide to Stainless Steel Passivation
Pickling is very similar to the basic passivation process in that a bath of acidic chemicals is used to strip the surface of the steel.However,where the basic passivation process uses mild nitric acid,pickling uses a more intensive chemical mixture,such as hydrofluoric acid.This stronger acid strips the surface layer of the steel,removing.Process for chemically shaving and pickling copper …27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;While the pickling may be performed in a batch process by dipping the coiled rod in an appropriate solution for a predetermined time period,it is also possible,and frequently desirable,to employ a continuous pickling process,such as the so called &quot;Dr.Otto&quot; pickling system,wherein loops of copper rod from the coil are passed sequentially.
