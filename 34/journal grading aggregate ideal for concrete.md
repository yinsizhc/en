## JULY 2015 FHWA HIF 15 019 Tech Brief
The combined grading of aggregates used in concrete mixtures for paving applications can have a direct impact on workability,and indirectly on mixture performance.The measurement of what comprises a good combined gradation is the topic of this tech brief.Mixtures that must be heavily vibrated because the workability is poor run theThe effect of aggregate grading on concrete strengthThe effect of aggregate grading on concrete strength.Q.How does the grading of the aggregates affect the strength of concrete? A.When the w cm is the same and the mixtures are plastic and workable,considerable changes in grading will not have a large effect on concrete strength.The principal effect of changing the aggregate grading is to change the amount of cementitious material.
