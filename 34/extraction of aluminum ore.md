## BBC GCSE Bitesize: Extraction of aluminium
Aluminium is the most abundant metal on Earth.Despite this,it is expensive,largely because of the amount of electricity used up in the extraction process.Aluminium ore is called bauxite.The bauxite is purified to yield a white powder,aluminium oxide,from which aluminium can be extracted.The.Aluminum processing Ores BritannicaAluminum processing Aluminum processing Ores: Aluminum is the third most abundant element on Earth’s surface.Only oxygen and silicon are more common.Earth’s crust to a depth of 16 km (10 miles) contains 8 percent aluminum.Aluminum has a strong tendency to combine with other common elements and so rarely occurs in nature in the metallic form.
