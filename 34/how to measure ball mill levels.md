## How to Handle the Charge Volume of a Ball Mill or Rod Mill.
 · As a result,mills are seldom run with charge levels greater than 45%.In rod mills,the charge is swollen by particles of feed which separate the rods.If the mill is shut down immediately after the feed is shut off,the charge level will be greater than if the mill had been “ground out” prior to shutdown.Ball mill is widely used in.GROSS POWER CALCULATOR SMC TestingFigures 5 and 6 respectively Accurate measurements of the ball filling can only be made after the mill is ground out In this case the mill is operated with the feed turned off until all of the ore has exited the mill Measurements of the ball level within the mill can then be made Figure 7 shows an example of the balls in a mill after a.

## How to Check Millivolts With a Multimeter Hunker
To measure voltage across a circuit element,you have to connect the leads of the meter in parallel with the element.In the voltage setting,the meter has a high resistance so very little current runs through it.A multimeter can measure electrical current and resistance as well as voltage.Optimization of mill performance by usingAs the ball wear rate depends directly on the surface of the media charge,a small variation in power will lead to an important increase of wear rate The risk of underloading or overloading the mill is an additional factor A direct measurement of the ball level in the mill,more accurate than power readings,as well as a control of it,is
