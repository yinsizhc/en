## Mining McLanahan
Generally in minerals processing,minerals are recovered from their ores using several operations,including comminution,sizing,concentration and dewatering.The term "minerals processing" can be applied to a wide array of industries,such as gold,coal,nickel,aluminum,oil sands,phosphate,potash,copper,iron ore and many more.Froth Flotation Process Mineral Processing & MetallurgyThe Froth Flotation Process is about taking advantage of the natural hydrophobicity of liberated (well ground) minerals metals and making playing on making them hydrophobic (water repel) individually to carefully separate them from one another and the slurry they are in.For this purpose we use chemicals reagents: Frothers (MIBC) is what allows the formation of air bubbles.
