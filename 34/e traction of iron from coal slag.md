The molten iron has a dissolved carbon content of approximately 3.6% as well as some silicon,manganese,vanadium,and titanium.Slag,which floats on top of the iron,has the function of removing impurities from the iron and its chemical composition and temperature to a large extent determine the chemistry and hence quality of the iron.Slag WikipediaIt is in the blast furnace that extraction of iron occurs.The extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process,that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag.What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.
