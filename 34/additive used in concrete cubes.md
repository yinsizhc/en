Use of wastewater sludge in concrete mixes organic sludge was used in making Additive Used In Concrete Cubes concrete cubeUsing cube tests in lieu of cylinder testsUsing cube tests in lieu of cylinder tests.Q.Can ASTM C109 cube tests be used in lieu of ASTM C39 cylinder tests? A.Mortar cube tests (ASTM C109) could be a good indicator of potential strength,but they should not be the sole basis for evaluating concrete strength.To meet ACI 318 requirements,concrete tests should be run on trial batches of concrete made with proposed aggregates.
