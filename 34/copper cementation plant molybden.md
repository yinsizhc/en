## Essential Plant Nutrients Blue Planet Nutrients
Essential Plant Nutrients These 16 essential elements,also called nutrients,are often split into two groups.Plants obtain carbon (C),hydrogen (H),and oxygen (O) from air and water.Role of Molybdenum in Agricultural Plant Production.The greatest concern associated with high plant molybdenum levels is with crops used for grazing or silage production.Ruminant animals,which consume plant tissues high in molybdenum content,can suffer from molybdenosis,a disorder that induces copper deficiencies (Scott,1972).Fortunately this disorder can be controlled by directly.

## Molybdenum in plants and soils
Molybdenum in plants and soils.Molybdenum is essential to plant growth as a component of the enzymes nitrate reductase and nitrogenase.Legumes need more molybdenum than other crops,such as grass or corn,because the symbiotic bacteria living in the root nodules of legumes require molybdenum for the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen.Molybdenum And Plants Importance Of Molybdenum For Plant.Even as a trace mineral,molybdenum for plant growth is an essential element.In the absence of enough of the mineral,leaves turn pale and eventually die,flowers fail to form and some plant species experience malformed leaf blades in a condition called whiptail.
