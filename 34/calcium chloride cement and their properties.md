## Mixing Mortar
The quantity necessary to lower the freezing point to any appreciable degree is so large it will seriously impair the strength and other desirable properties of the mortar.Do not add more than 2 percent calcium chloride (an accelerator) by weight of cement to mortar to accelerate its hardening rate and increase its early strength.Role of Calcium Chloride in Concrete theconstructor.orgCalcium chloride is known to increase drying shrinkage,the magnitude depending on the amount of calcium chloride added,the type of cement,the period of curing,and environmental conditions.6.Efflorescence.Due to use of calcium chloride in concrete,a whitish deposit is formed on the cured concrete surface in some instances.
