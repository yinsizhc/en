## Iron ore Wikipedia
Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.Indeed,it has been argued that iron ore is "more integral to the global economy than any other commodity,except perhaps oil ".iron ore processing screen pmetro.itFINE SCREEN FOR IRON ORE DRESSING PROCESS.FINE SCREEN FOR IRON ORE DRESSING PROCESS.As we all know,the magnetic separator equipment plays a role in the iron ore dressing process.However,in the whole process of processing,not only the magnetic separator is one kind of equipment,but also some other equipment can show other functions,today we will share one of them: fine screen.

Narvik is situated at the Ofotfjord,north of the Arctic Circle,and has an average annual temperature of around 4&#176 C.Thanks to these temperatures,which are influenced by the Gulf Stream,the fjord remains free of ice almost all year round.This is where the processing plant of Scandinavia's biggest iron ore producer is loed,with a facility for direct loading of iron ore pellets ontoIntroduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processesThe various advantages of iron ore pellets are given below.Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production.Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).
