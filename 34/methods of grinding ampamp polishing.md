## Polished Concrete Process
Polishing Process The process begins with the use of coarse diamond segments bonded in a metallic matrix.These segments are coarse enough to remove minor pits,blemishes,stains,or light coatings from the floor in preparation for final smoothing.Depending on the condition of the concrete,this initial rough grinding is generally a three to four step process.Advances and Processes in Precision Glass Polishing Technique1Table 1.Classification of polishing methods 3.1 Full Lap Polishing Processes (Conventional Methods) Principle: There are three popular theories of glass polishing.Hooke,Newton and Rayleigh proposed the 'wear theory',which says that the polishing takes place by the mechanical wear of the abrasives and the surface of glass.In short it is.
