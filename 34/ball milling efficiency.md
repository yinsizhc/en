## How to Measure Grinding Efficiency
The first two Grinding Efficiency Measurement examples are given to show how to calculate Wio and Wioc for single stage ball mills.Figure 1.The first example is a comparison of two parallel mills from a daily operating report.Mill size 5.03m x 6.1m (16.5′ x 20′ with a ID of 16′).This example shows that Mill 2 is slightly more efficient than Mill 1 even though it has a higher power.Grinding Aids for Ball Mills Industrial Efficiency.A ball mill generally loses its grinding efficiency remarkably at fine grinding.This is because fine particles from ground materials agglomerate and adhere to the mill liners or grinding media as coating,reducing the impulsive force of the mill.
