## Water to Cement Ratio and Aggregate Moisture Corrections
In order to produce concrete with a lower water to cement ratio,chemical admixtures can reduce the required amount of mixing water and still obtain the desired fresh properties to facilitate the placement and consolidation of the concrete.One of the key parameters in producing high strength concrete is the use of a low w c ratio.Aggregates for Concrete2018 8 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;erosion of rocks produce particles of stone,gravel,sand,silt,and clay.Recycled concrete,or crushed waste concrete,is a feasible source of aggregates and an economic reality,especially where good aggregates are scarce.Conven .(AASHTO T 97) strength achieved with purified sand

## The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete
The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.6 Types of Deleterious Substances in AggregateOrganic impurities,clay,silt and crushed dust,salts,unsound particles,and alkali aggregate reactions.Adverse effects of deleterious materials on concrete includes the increase of water demand in concrete,impair bond strength between cement and aggregate,reduce durability,result in concrete popouts,and impair wear resistance.
