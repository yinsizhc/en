## Blast furnace Wikipedia
A blast furnace is a type of metallurgical furnace used for smelting to produce industrial metals,generally pig iron,but also others such as lead or copper.Blast refers to the combustion air being "forced" or supplied above atmospheric pressure.In a blast furnace,fuel (),ores,and flux are continuously supplied through the top of the furnace,while a hot blast of air (sometimes with.Solid Waste Management in a Steel Plant IspatGuruSep 29,2014 · The air cooled BF slag is either dumped as landfills or used in road repairs within the steel plant.In either case the iron contamination of the slag is separated and sold for re melting.Flue dust and GCP dry dust (in case of dry gas cleaning) are recycled in sinter making.
