## Ball Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Ball and Rod Mill PK MiningRod mills are grinding machine which employ high carbon steel or special steel rods of nearly the same length as that of the drum,in place of steel balls in ball mills.Rod mill products are generally coarser than those produced in a ball mill,and rod mills are well suited to handle coarser feed and to control the top size of the product.
