## Silicon Manufacturing The Silicon Manufacturing Process
 · Silicon metal is made from the reaction of silica and carbon materials like coke,coal and wood chips.When it comes to the manufacturing of silicon for wafers,the process can generally be broken down into three steps.Those steps are reduction,cooling,and packaging.Let’s take a deeper look at the three main steps used in silicon.FROM SAND TO THE SILICON WAFER — SteemitThe primary processing step for the production of silicon from sand is the production of metallurgical grade silicon via a metallurgical reductionprocess.The sand is first introduced in an electric arc furnacewith carbon,at approximately 3000 C.As a consequence,the silicon is.

The process starts with sand.But not just any kind of sand or even beach sand.The particles that act as the starting point for silicon wafers are specifically mined,heated to thousands of degrees and purified to produce an ultimately flawless cylinder of silicon.The silicon is then sliced into wafers which are then polished.How is Silicone Made? SIMTECMay 24,2017&#0183;&#32;Isolating silicon from silica is the first step in the production of silicone This is done by heating a large volume of quartz sand to temperatures as high as 1800˚C The result is pure,isolated silicon,which is allowed to cool and then ground into a fine powder To make silicone,this fine silicon powder is combined with methyl chloride.

## Silicon Wafer Processing
Most of the sand used for these processes is shipped from the beaches of Australia Step 2: Preparing the Molten Silicon Bath The sand (SiO2)is taken and put into a crucible and is heated to about 1600 degrees C just above its melting point The molten sand will become the source of the silicon that will be the wafer Step 3: Making the IngotSilicon Wafer Processing2007 9 13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The silicon is supplied in granular powder form,then melted in a crucible.The seed is immersed carefully into the crucible of molten silicon,then slowly withdrawn.Step 1: Obtaining the Sand The sand used to grow the wafers has to be a very clean and good form of silicon.For this reason not just any sand scraped off the beach will do.
