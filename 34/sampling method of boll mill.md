## Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.
A ball mill also known as pebble mill or tumbling mill is a milling machine that consists of a hallow cylinder containing balls; mounted on a metallic frame such that it can be rotated along its longitudinal axis.The balls which could be of different diameter occupy 30 50% of the mill volume and its size depends on the feed and mill size.Grinding Mills FLSmidthgrinding mills.Grinding mills supplied by FLSmidth have their origins dating back to the Fuller Company,based in Bethlehem,Pennsylvania,USA.Fuller has been a leading supplier of grinding mills under the Traylor brand name since 1902 and many of the largest plants operating today have these world renowned SAG and Ball Mills operating in.
