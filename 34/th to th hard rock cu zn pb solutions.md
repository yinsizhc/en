Combining the synoptic mass balance approach with principal components analysis (PCA) can be an effective method for discretising the chemistry of inflows and source areas in watersheds where contamination is diffuse in nature and or complicated by groundwater interactions.This paper presents a field scale study in which synoptic sampling and PCA are employed in a mineralized watershed (Lion.Isotope dilution mass spectrometry for quantitative.TN,USA).SRM series 3100 monoelemental solutions of Cu,Zn,Ba and Pb from NIST were used for the characterization of the corresponding spike abundances and mass fractions by reverse isotope dilution ICP MS (see Table 1).2.2.Samples preparation by lithium borate fusion Glasses of each SRM were prepared by lithium borate fusion by
