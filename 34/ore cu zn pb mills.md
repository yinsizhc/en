## Penn Mine (MRDS #10310664) CU,ZN,PB,AU,AG
The Penn Mine operated intermittently between 1861 and 1952 and produced an estimated 973,784 tons of ore which yielded 82,534,054 pounds of copper,22,196,482 pounds of zinc,1,225798 pounds of lead,67,773 ounces of gold,2,150,304 ounces of silverPenn Mine (MRDS #10310664) CU,ZN,PB,AU,AGKemp (1982) defined the island arc setting in which the Foothill Copper Zinc Belt deposits are situated.Schmidt (1978) defined the textural and structural attributes,stratigraphic framework,and the sulfide ore mineralogy at the Penn Mine and concluded these deposits are more indicative of Kuroko type syngenetic volcanogenic sulfides.
