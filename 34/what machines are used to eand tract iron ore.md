## Iron Ore Magnetic Separation
Fe ore was made,shipped to Braddock furnace and used there by James Gayley.This,I think,was the first use of magnetic iron ore concentrates in a blast furnace.The small machine was of the belt type.Mr.Ball soon after designed a drum type machine,and later a double drum machine in which a three part separation was made.Iron Ore Smelting Process Brighthub EngineeringThe ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone.Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature.The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke,the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron.The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace,the slag being.
