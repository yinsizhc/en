Asphalt pavement production consists of mixing sand and aggregate with asphalt or bitumen.The process produces a hot,concrete mix that is laid on road surfaces.It is a common industry practice to mix in recycled asphalt paving with the new concrete mix.However,some probRecyclingCare should be taken to avoid removing the fines from the reclaimed HMA pavement since the fines retain much of the aged asphalt that is to be recycled.The crusher should not also produce an increase in fine size material or new fractured faces which can require more virgin binder material and henc

## The Definitive Guide to Using Recycled Asphalt Pavement
This is one of the many reasons why recycled asphalt pavement (sometimes referred to as reclaimed asphalt pavement,or simply,RAP) has become so popular throughout the country.In fact,according to the National Asphalt Pavement Association (NAPA),asphalt pavement is now America's most recycled and reused material.Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement Tropical AsphaltHot Mix Asphalt Hot mix asphalt can be produced in either of two ways; at a central processing facility,or through in place recycling.At the central processing facility,the reclaimed asphalt pavement undergoes crushing,screening,and stacking,which results in a granular RAP product.
