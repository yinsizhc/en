## The Difference Between Cement And Concrete Today I Found Out
Dec 05,2011&#0183;&#32;Today I found out the difference between Cement and Concrete.In general terms,the word cement refers to any kind of binder that tightly holds other materials together.Concrete,on the other hand,is a mixture of materials like sand,gravel,and small rocks combined with any type of cement and water.What is Aggregates Aggregate Definition & its Types.I hope that Aggregate Definition will be cleared.Qualities of Aggregates.Following are the most important qualities of an Aggregate.1.It should be chemically inert,i.e.they should not react with cement or any other aggregate or admixture.2.It should possess sufficient hardness to resist scratching and abrasion in the hardened state.3.
