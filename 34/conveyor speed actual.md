In reality,the actual cure time would be even less for a 300°F curing product.the conveyor speed could be increased to 13 feet per min ute,or more than 60% over the original eight feet per minute.Assuming the ability to load and unload the line at this speed is maintained,the net effect would be more than a 60% increase in throughput.NASA Study Finds Atlantic 'Conveyor Belt' Not Slowing · New NASA measurements of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation,part of the global ocean conveyor belt that helps regulate climate around the North Atlantic,show no significant slowing over the past 15 years.
