## LOW SULFIDE AU QUARTZ VEINS (MODEL 36a; Berger,1986)
(Model 39a).Low sulfide gold quartz vein deposits subjected to tropical weathering can produce lateritic saprolite (eluvial placer) deposits (Model 38g; McKelvey,1992).Much older,pre accretionary Cyprus,Besshi,and Kuroko volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits (Models 24a,24b,28a) are spatially associated with gold veins in terranes thatLocation Of Gold Deposits Eluvial Placers ~ Technology.Location Of Gold Deposits Eluvial Placers Eluvial ore deposits are those such as tungsten and gold placer deposits formed by settling and enriched by the winnowing or removal of lower density materials.such as quartz floats at the foot of hills and mountains rather than farther uphill and at the outcrop of auriferous quartz veins.Finally.
