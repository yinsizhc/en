Feb 08,2017&#0183;&#32;The operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls Then,Planetary Ball Mills 101 unionprocess.comPlanetary ball mills share the same design as other basic ball mills a grinding jar filled with media and rotated on its own axis.But their unique design takes advantage of centrifugal force and the Coriolis effect to grind materials to a very fine or even micron size.
