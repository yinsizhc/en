## MILLING &amp;ANALYSIS OF PARTICLES AUTUMN 2010
The changing particle size distribution of the milled good as a function of time is most easy to characterize qualitatively if the material has initially only one particle size.At the start of milling the ﬁrst size class is continually diminished,(Curve A Fig.3) ﬁrst faster and then slower.An average particle size class is initially.Roller mills: Precisely reducing particle size with greater efficiency …The roller mill minimizes such costs by precisely reducing feed materials with an average particle size up to 3⁄ 4 inch to a uniform average size typically between 100 and 2,000 microns.The roller mill’s ability to reduce materials to a uniform particle size provides
