## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold.Palladium Mining,Techniques,Mines,Occurence,PGM,Metal.Palladium is normally a platinum group Metal (PGM).It is a rare element and occurs along with deposits of platinum,nickel,copper,silver and gold and is therefore obtained as a byproduct of mining these metals i.e.PGM.The mining of palladium is a very intricate process because of the fact that palladium is so spread out under the surface and in the mines and requires using mechanical.
