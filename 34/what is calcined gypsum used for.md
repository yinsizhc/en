## Accelerator for gypsum plaster and process of manufacture.
Jul 21,1987 · The most common accelerator used for reducing the setting time of calcined gypsum is calcium sulfate dihydrate that has been ground to a high degree of fineness.When freshly prepared,it has high potency.However,when stored prior to use,particularly in the presence of moisture or heat,it loses its effectiveness.Gypsum Calcination InnogypsCalcination is the practice of dehydrating gypsum into plaster or stucco through a batch or continuous process which includes heating the gypsum to evaporate the crystalline water.Typically,free water is removed in an initial process at approximately 45℃ and crystalline bound water is removed in a second process at 120 180℃.
