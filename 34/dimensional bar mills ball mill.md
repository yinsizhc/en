## Rolling (metalworking) Wikipedia
Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material.After the grains deform during processing,they recrystallize,which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal,like semi finished casting products,such as slabs,blooms,and billets.rod reducing sizing millsROD MILLS Rod mills are limited in size to 2000 kW because the longest commercial grinding rod available is 6 m long.For this reason rod mills are rarely selected in the present day environment of large AG SAG mills and large ball mills.However,it is necessary to discuss their operation because a Rod.
