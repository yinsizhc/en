## Efficient Selection of Process Mining Algorithms
Abstract: While many process mining algorithms have been proposed recently,there does not exist a widely accepted benchmark to evaluate and compare these process mining algorithms.As a result,it can be difficult to choose a suitable process mining algorithm for a given enterprise or application domain.Some recent benchmark systems have been developed and proposed to address this issue.(PDF) PROCESS MINING ALGORITHMSSeveral algorithms have been proposed for process mining.Many of these algorithms cannot deal with concurrency.Other typical problems are the presence of duplicate activities,hidden activities.

## Process Mining using Power BI Microsoft Power BI Community
@ajrajes is your question about visuals that are produced or the actual process of process mining ?From what little I know process mining requires complex algorithms applied to the data.Power bi is your visualisation tool.While you can do data manipulation tasks in power bi you can't do complex algorithms that process mining requires.Process Mining Using BPMN: Relating Event Logs and.Process Mining Using BPMN: Relating Event Logs and Process Models 3 With the help of a conversion algorithm,we construct a BPMN model from the Petri net,as shown in Fig.2.This BPMN model is more compact than the initial Petri net.Thus,the result of process mining is available in a BPMN notation now; this BPMN model can be easily imported and

## Process mining
2020 2 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Process mining is a family of techniques in the field of process management that support the analysis of business processes based on event logs.During process mining,specialized data mining algorithms are applied to event log data in order to identify trends,patterns and details contained in event logs recorded by an information system.How Microsoft uses process mining to accelerate …2020 2 21&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Process mining intelligent algorithms use this data to monitor process performance of business processes.Process mining is applicable to any business processes that are mostly (or entirely) repetitive and transactional in nature.The only requirement is having data in the form of transaction steps,and date and time stamps that can be used as.

Data Mining mode is created by applying the algorithm on top of the raw data.The mining model is more than the algorithm or metadata handler.It is a set of data,patterns,statistics that can be serviceable on new data that is being sourced to generate the predictions and get some inference about the relationships.
