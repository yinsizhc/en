## Beneficiation of Oolitic Iron Ores Hatch Ltd
Mineral processing of the ore to generate a commercial iron ore concentrate is very challenging due to the nature of these ores.Accordingly,Hatch and Ironstone are developing a new pyrometallurgical process (Hatch Ironstone Chloride Segregation) to produce metallic iron from high silica and high phosphorus oolitic iron ores.Following the.beneficiation goethite iron ore gne id orgbeneficiation goethite iron ore gne id org Iron ore Wikipedia.Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel.Indeed,it has been argued that iron ore is &quot;more integral to the global economy than any other commodity,except perhaps oil &quot;.
