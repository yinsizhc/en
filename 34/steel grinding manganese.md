## Manganese Wikipedia
Manganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn and atomic number 25.It is not found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron.Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses,particularly in stainless steels.Manganese SteelIf the manganese steel is used in applications for which it was designed,where gouging and high stress abrasion predominate,the steel will rapidly work harden.The high work hardening capacity enables manganese steel to absorb huge amount of energy through the strain hardening mechanism.

Manganese steel has no equal in it ability to work harden.Although it is normally reported that a maximum hardness of about 550 BHN is obtainable,typical maximum hardness on worn castings is in the 400 450 BHN range.It is generally believed that manganese steel has poor abrasion resistance unless it has been work hardened.Welding Manganese Steel PlateJan 26,2007 · Historically this material has been named firstly by R.A.Hadfield (Journal of the Iron Steel Institute Vol.34; 1888 II; page 41 82) in 1888.In term of metallurgical aspects this iron based "steel" is actually a "cast" alloy,containing 1.2% Carbon (C) mean and 12% Manganese (Mn) mean and is being rolled or forged after casting.
