Mineral Processing.If the mineralogy of the ore shows that you can separate discrete particles of the mineral you want from the gangue components of the ore,then it is possible to physically concentrate the valuable mineral and reject the rest.The easiest method for achieving this is by gravity separation.SOLUTION AfuruikaWhat kind of solution do you want to know? More than 30 kinds of solutions can be chosen for the metal,non metal and tailings,our experts working in the laboratory to research the best solution for mine samples each day,Best solution + best design +best research.

## Mineral Processing
Mineral Processing Golden Mile ore is of two main types: weathered oxide ore from near the surface which is free milling with the gold easy to extract,and sulphide ore in deeper ore bodies where the majority of the gold is locked as inclusions in tellurides and pyrites and is difficult to extract.Assessment of options for economic processing of preg.(2012).Assessment of options for economic processing of preg robbing gold ores.Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy: Vol.121,Australian gold processing,pp.217 223.

## Gold processing 101 Mining Magazine
In most cases,gold processing with cyanide leaching,usually with carbon adsorption,is still the core technology and the critical thing is understanding the mineralogy in order to optimise flowsheet selection and cost drivers,and get the best out of the process.is a little more complex for gold ores,as the optimal process flowsheet.Oxidant Addition During Gold Ore ProcessingThe increase in the proportion of sulphide ore treated by the gold mining industry has led to generally higher oxygen requirements.Additions of pure oxygen,hydrogen peroxide and in some cases calcium peroxide,have been proposed as a means of satisfying the oxygen demand and overcoming the problems from reactive sulphides in the ore.Current.

Common Methods for Gold Mineral Processing： 1.Gravity Concentration According to the difference between the density of ore grains,the gravity,fluid power and other mechanical forces are different in the moving medium,so as to achieve a mineral processingThe process mineralogy of gold: The classification of …The principal gold minerals that affect the processing of gold ores are native gold,electrum,Au Ag tellurides,aurostibite,maldonite,and auricupride.In addition,submicroscopic (solid solution) gold,principally in arsenopyrite and pyrite,is also important.The main causes of refractory gold ores are submicroscopic gold,the Au Ag tellurides,and very fine grained gold (&amp;lt;10 &#181;m.
