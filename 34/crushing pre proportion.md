## Tips for maintaining efficiency in crushing circuits Quarry
Pre screening of the feed to remove the fines,especially in tertiary crushing,is a good practice; it helps to avoid packing of material in the chamber while maintaining an efficient,effective crushing action and increasing your crusher efficiency.Crushing setting: EfficiencyNo Magic Bullet to Reduce Pre Wean Mortality in Pigs.“And the best units do very well,with less than 10% pre wean mortality.It’s within scope to reduce those numbers significantly.” Primary causes of pre wean mortality Crushing by the sow and starvation are the leading causes of pre wean mortality,Ellis said,and that hasn’t changed over the years.

## Concrete Mix Ratios Cement,Sand,Aggregate and Water
Concrete mix ratio of 1:3:3 On mixing 1 part cement,3 parts sand with 3 parts aggregate produces concrete with a compressive strength of 3000 psi.On mixing water with the three ingredients,a paste is formed that binds them together till the concrete mix gets hardened.The strength concrete is inversely proportional to the water cement ratio.Reinforced Concrete DesignConcrete: Concrete is a stone like substance obtained by permitting a carefully proportioned mixture of cement,sand and gravel or other aggregate and water to harden in forms of the shape and of dimensions of the desired structure.Reinforced cement concrete: Since concrete is a brittle material and is strong in compression.It is weak in tension,so steel is used inside concrete for.
