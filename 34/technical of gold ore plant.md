## Sorting: Possibilities,Limitations and Future
Ore sorting has a potential to upgrade a range of mineral ores to processing plant leading to substantial reduction in downstream costs,limiting environmental harm by reducing mine wastes and improving ore quality and mineral recovery.Ore sorting techniques give an opportunity to remove gangue and below grade ore prior to main processing step.Processing,smelting and refining gold World Gold …2020 2 28&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;When gold dissolution is complete,the gold bearing solution is separated from the solids.With ores of higher gold content (greater than 20 grams of gold per tonne of ore),cyanidation is accomplished by vat leaching,which involves holding a slurry of ore …
