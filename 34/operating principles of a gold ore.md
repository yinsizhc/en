## Ball mill Wikipedia
The ball mill is a key piece of equipment for grinding crushed materials,and it is widely used in production lines for powders such as cement,silicates,refractory material,fertilizer,glass ceramics,etc.as well as for ore dressing of both ferrous and non ferrous metals.The ball mill can grind various ores and other materials either wet or dry.Principles of Mining Mining Guidegold ores.On several gold mines,however,tests on accumulated samples for their sulphide percentage showed a distinctly greater ratio than the tenor of the ore itself in the mill.As the gold is usually associated with the sulphides,the samples showed higher values than the mill.In general,some considerable factor of safety must be allowed
