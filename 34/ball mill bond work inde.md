The ability to simulate the Bond work index test also allows examination of truncated ball mill feed size distributions on the work index.For grinding circuits where the feed to a ball mill is sent directly to the classifier and the cyclone underflow feeds the ball mill (see Figure 3.10),a question arises as to whether this practice will alter the ball mill work index (BW i) of the material.QUICK METHOD FOR BOND WORK INDEXAPPROXIMATE VALUE …The aim of this study was to develop a new method for assessing the Bond work index in a ball mill (BBWI),which is based on a first order kinetics present in the Bond ball mill for grinding mineral raw materials (Austin et al.1981; Ahmadi and Shahsavari,2009).
