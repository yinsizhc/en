What are the basic properties of the. · Generally,aggregate properties affect not only the concrete mixture proportions but also the behavior of fresh and hardened concrete.Due to considerable overlap between the two,it is more appropriate to divide the study of aggregate properties into three categories that are based on microstructural and processing factors.
