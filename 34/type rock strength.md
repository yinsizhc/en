## Stress and Strain
Mar 11,2019 · There are many factors that contribute to the style of the deformation in a rock,including pressure,temperature,rock composition,presence or absence of fluids,type of stress,rate of stress,and others.However,the type of stress,the rate of stress and the temperature may be the most critical factors for most introductory students.LABORATORY TESTS TO DETERMINE STRENGTH OF ROCKSLaboratory tests for determining strength of Rocks Following are common laboratory tests for determining strength of rocks: Unconfined compression tests for rocks Triaxial compression test for rocks Splitting tension test for rocks Beam bending test for rocks Ring shear test for rocks Unconfined Compression Test on Rocks It is more commonly.

## HOW TO DESCRIBE ROCK MASS CHARACTERISTICS ON SITE.
Rock Material Description 1.Rock Type.The rock type is defined by the origin of the rock (i.e.sedimentary,metamorphic,igneous),color (including whether light or dark minerals predominate),texture or fabric ranging from crystalline,granular,or glassy,and grain size ranging from boulders to silt clay size particles.2.Wall StrengthRock strength from log parameters PetroWikiAn understanding of rock strength is important for designing recovery plans for a reservoir and for developing an appropriate reservoir simulation.A detailed discussion of rock failure can be found in Rock failure relationships and Compressive strength of rocks.But the data needed for these methods may not be readily available,so there is a desire to use data available from well logs that are.
