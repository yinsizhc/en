Direct reduction of iron ore refers to the conversion of solid iron ore to metallic iron without conversion to the liquid phase [37].Majority of the direct reduced iron (DRI) [38] is produced by reacting iron oxide with hydrocarbon based reducing gases produced from reforming natural gas …Processing of red mud by low temperature microwave. ICSOBAa Low Temperature Microwave Hydrogen Plasma Reduction Process using.The product so obtained contains 95% Fe with low carbon and sulphur.Process flow sheet for the production of green direct reduced iron (DRI) from red mud.
