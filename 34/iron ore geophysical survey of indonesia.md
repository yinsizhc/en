## Exploration geophysics Wikipedia
Exploration geophysics is an applied branch of geophysics and economic geology,which uses physical methods,such as seismic,gravitational,magnetic,electrical and electromagnetic at the surface of the Earth to measure the physical properties of the subsurface,along with the anomalies in those properties.It is most often used to detect or infer the presence and position of economically.Latest statistics releaseIron ore recorded sales valued at $78.2 billion in 2018 19,up 26 per cent on the previous year and a new record for iron ore sales values.This was largely achieved on the back of improved iron ore prices as the volume of iron ore sold actually declined from 839 million tonnes (Mt) to just less than 794 Mt.

Primary gold deposits are formed from gold bearing fluids at sites where the chemistry and physical characteristics permit gold deposition.Gold that is liberated through weathering is concentrated in alluvial (placer) deposits such as those that sparked the rushes of the 1850s,but these are no longer major sources in Australia.Application of the gravity method to iron ore exploration.The gravity method was first applied to Fe ore exploration as a tool for detecting nonmagnetic ores,but advantages of this method over other exploration methods have also made it useful under certain geological conditions in the study of magnetic ores and regional structures favorable for the occurrence of Fe ore.

## SURFACE GEOPHYSICAL INVESTIGATIONS
Surface geophysical surveys have been applied to mineral and petroleum exploration for many years.A magnetic compass was used in Sweden in the mid 1600s to find iron ore deposits.The lateral extent of the Comstock ore body was mapped using self potential methods in the 1880s.AGeology,Prospecting and Exploration for Iron Ore Deposits.Apr 09,2015 · Exploitation of existing iron ore deposit is the easier part of the mining operations.The harder part is to find new ore deposits and to define their extent and the iron content (grade).Exploration is the process by which the accumulations of iron ore minerals can be found in the earth's crust.
