## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().The energy efficiency of ball milling in comminution.Earlier work by Fuerstenau and Kapur on the comminution of quartz in a single particle roll mill and in a dry ball mill showed the energy efficiency of ball mill comminution to be 22%.Thus,as a mechanical device for producing fine particles,the ball mill is reasonably efficient energetically.

## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Micronization of a Soft Material: Air Jet and Micro Ball.Nov 24,2010 · The yield achieved with the micro ball mill was 100% but was ~80% for the air jet mill,which reduced the size of Pluronic® F 68 from 70 μm to sizes ranging between 23 39 μm median diameters.Ball milling produced particles less than 10 μm after 15 min.
