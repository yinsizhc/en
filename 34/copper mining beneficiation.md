## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.Exporting finished copper Mining For ZambiaCopper goes through many similar phases of beneficiation.It is converted from ore to copper concentrate,and then into copper anode,and then into copper cathode,which is 99.99% pure.Cathode copper is then processed further into tubes,sheets,wiring and other forms.

## From Ore to Finished Product
2020 1 1&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Copper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.Life cycle assessment on lead zinc ore mining and.Due to the insufficient technology and management,the environmental impacts caused by lead zinc ore mining and beneficiation in China have not been effectively settled.The whole processes of lead zinc ore mining and beneficiation should be comprehensively explored,so as to formulate practical technical countermeasures and management strategies.
