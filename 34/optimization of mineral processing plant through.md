## SIMULTANEOUS OPTIMIZATION OF FLOTATION COLUMN.
Mineral processing is a field that has seen limited application of AI although there are certainly some successful examples.Achieving the maximum grade and recovery of concentration of column flotation is an important research topic that a mineral processing plant is planned to reach by optimization of the operation conditions.Comparative Study of Optimization Schemes in …Modelling and simulations for mineral processing plants have been successful in replicating and predicting predefined scenarios of an operating plant.However,there is a need to explore and increase the potential of such simulations to make them attractive for users.One of the tools to increase the attractiveness of the simulations is through applying optimization schemes.Optimization.
