## Electric Motor Power Measurement and Analysis Yokogawa.
Electric motors are electromechanical machines that convert electric energy into mechanical energy.Despite differences in size and type,all electric motors work in much the same way: an electric current flowing through a wire coil in a magnetic field creates a force that rotates the coil,thus creating torque.AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills & Circuits Mining Mill.Ball Mill Operation Ball mills ride on steel tires or supported on both ends by trunnions.Girth gears bolted to the shell drive the mill through a pinion shaft from a prime mover drive.The prime movers are usually synchronized motors.
