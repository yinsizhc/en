## Increase throughput and capacity in SAG mills
SAG mills are the main workhorses in the majority of comminution circuits globally.They need to be fed and kept working round the clock.But challenges can arise when capacity is not optimised causing unnecessary downtime and liner wear leading to the one sound operators do not want to hear the sound of the mills standing still.Three shortcuts to improve production capacity of ball millBall mill grinding mill efficiency and productivity improvement,efficiency,intermittent ball mill,machinery,ball mill grinding efficiency and yield of the price increase is a common fine grinding mill machinery spare parts,in the mineral processing industry,building materials and chemicals have applications in the field.
