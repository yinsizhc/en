## How Does Limestone Affect the Environment? Reference.com
Limestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes.When limestone dissolves while it's still in the ground,caves and gullies form,a natural phenomenon known as karst.Although this doesn't hurt the environment in its natural form,once the limestone is mined out,sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.Limestone: The Calcium Carbonate Chemical Sedimentary RockBleiwas,D.I.2011,Estimates of electricity requirements for the recovery of mineral commodities,with examples applied to sub Saharan Africa: U.S.Geological Survey Open File Report 2011 1253,100 p.
