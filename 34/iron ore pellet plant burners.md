## Iron ore Wikipedia
Iron ore is the raw material used to make pig iron,which is one of the main raw materials to make steel—98% of the mined iron ore is used to make steel Indeed,it has been argued that iron ore is "more integral to the global economy than any other commodity,except perhaps oil "Iron Ore Pellets Iron OreOne way to achieve this is to agglomorate the ore into pellets,which are round balls of concentrated ore.I will attempt to describe the iron ore pelletizing process below.In the palletisation plant,a suitable binder such as Bentonite is added to ground iron ore or iron ore concentrate which is mixed in a.
