## What Is a Bond and How Do Bond Investments Work? The Balance
Feb 17,2020 · A bond,in its basic form,is a type of loan.An investor takes their money and temporarily lends it to the bond issuer.In exchange,the investor receives interest income at a predetermined rate (the coupon rate) and at predetermined times (the coupon date).The bond has an expiration date (the maturity date) at which point the stated par value of the bond must be returned.evaluation of bond working inde at mill processing1.Introduction.A Bond Ball Mill Work Index test is a standard test for determining the ball mill work index of a sample of ore.It was developed by Fred Bond in 1952 and modified in 1961 (JKMRC CO.2006).This index is widely used in the mineral industry for comparing the resistance of different materials to ball milling,for estimating the energy required for grinding,and for ball mill.
