## Exporting finished copper
Copper goes through many similar phases of beneficiation.It is converted from ore to copper concentrate,and then into copper anode,and then into copper cathode,which is 99.99% pure.Cathode copper is then processed further into tubes,sheets,wiring and other forms.Flotation characteristics of a complex copper ore: a.It is known that the grinding condition has a major effect on the beneficiation characteristics of the minerals in subsequent processing,in particular,flotation.In the flotation process,particles surface and their condition can significantly influence collector adsorption and flotation.
