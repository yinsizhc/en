## Learning About Cyclones &#187; Section 8
Design Practice.Now you can try to design a cyclone using the following web calculator program.First,you need to select one of the standard cyclones.Next,you'll need to provide the feed conditions (i.e.particle size distribution and loading).You then have the freedom to choose the operating conditions (e.g.cyclone body diameter,flow.ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY APTI 413: CyclonesThe outlet gas tube is also an important consideration in the design of a large diameter cyclone.Some of the energy due to the radial motion of the ascending gases can be recovered by scroll devices (A) or outlet drums (B) placed on top of the outlet tube.
