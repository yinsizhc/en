## Bogues Compounds in Cement and their Significance or Uses
Dec 30,2018 · Bogues compounds are responsible for initial setting of the cement grout.These compounds have been researched extensively by an American chemist named Rober Herman Bogue (R.H.Bogue) who is well known for his books on The Chemistry of Portland Cement and the Chemistry and Technology of Gelatin and Glue.After his extensive research,Bogue has devised a calculation.Chemical AdmixturesChemical admixtures are the ingredients in concrete other than portland cement,water,and aggregate that are added to the mix immediately before or during mixing.Producers use admixtures primarily to reduce the cost of concrete construction; to modify the properties of hardened concrete; to ensure the quality of concrete during mixing.
