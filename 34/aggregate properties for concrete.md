 · Aggregates are the major constituent (ingredient) in concrete,making up 60% to 70% of the volume of concrete.Aggregates influence the workability of plastic concrete and also the durability,strength,thermal properties,and density of hardened concrete.Particle size divides aggregates into two categories: fine and coarse.Most fine aggregates are sand and contain …WHAT ARE THE PROPERTIES OF AGGREGATES FOR …The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Concrete is a mixture of cementious material,aggregate,and water.Aggregate is commonly considered inert filler,which accounts for 60 to 80 percent of the volume and 70 to 85 percent of the weight of concrete.

## What are aggregates? What are the basic properties of …
Aggregate is a granular material,such as sand,gravel,crushed stone used with a cement to produce either concrete or mortar.Aggregate is relatively inexpensive and does not enter into complex chemical reactions with water; it has been customary,therefore,to treat it as inert filler in concrete and mortar.CONCRETE UPTConcrete is an artificial stone which is obtained after hardening the homogenous mixtures of cement,water,aggregates and sometime admixture and or additive (to modify the fresh and hardened concrete

## What is concrete? Hanson UK
Concrete is an engineering material that simulates the properties of rock and is a combination of particles closely bound together.It is simply a blend of aggregates,normally natural sand and gravel or crushed rock.These are bound together by a hydraulic binder e.g.…Properties of Stone Aggregates Civil Engineers PKProperties of Stone Aggregates Sand,gravel and crushed stone fall into this category and make up a large percentage of the aggregates used in concrete.Since they generally constitute from 60 to 80 percent of the volume of concrete,their characteristics influence the properties of concrete.

## Influence of Aggregate Properties on Concrete Shrinkage
A theory of the influence of aggregate properties on concrete shrinkage is presented.An equation is derived from which the shrinkage of concrete may be computed from the fractional volume,the modulus of elasticity,and the shrinkage of cement paste and aggregate.A comparison is made between theoretical and experimental results.Mechanical properties of concrete with recycled aggregates.Abstract.The present investigation analyses the mechanical behaviour of concrete with recycled aggregates from precast debris and waste glass.The combination of both recycled materials permits an increased amount of recycled coarse aggregates reducing the loss of mechanical performance of the concrete,and enhances the environmental value of.
