## Review on the innovative uses of steel slag for waste.
Piles of steel slag,a solid waste generated from the iron and steel industry,could be seen due to no utility found for the past century.Steel slag has now gained much attention because of its new applications.The properties of slag greatly influence its use and thus had got varied applications.The chemical composition of steel slag varies as the mineral composition of raw material such as.Use of Waste Materials in Highway Construction: State of.The waste products are currently in use (or being studied experimentally) in a variety of highway applications (see Table 1).Of the 27 waste products,only 11 (reclaimed paving materials,coal fly ash,rubber tires,blast furnace slag,steel slag,coal bottom ash,boiler slag,used motor oil,waste.
