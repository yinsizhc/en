## Properties of concrete Wikipedia
Concrete has relatively high compressive strength (it doesn't crack under weight),but significantly lower tensile strength (it cracks when being pulled).The compressive strength is typically controlled with the ratio of water to cement when forming the concrete,and tensile strength is increased by additives,typically steel,to create reinforced concrete.aggregate and c ncrete production equipmentsAggregate Processing and Aggregate Crushing Plant.Aggregate crushing plants are important equipment for aggregate processing.Aggregate commonly is classified into two egories: fine aggregate and coarse aggregate.Fine aggregate is the materials that could pass the No.4 sieve,and most could be remained on a No.200 sieve.
