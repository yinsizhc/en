## Eliminating Copper from Gold Ore
When reviewing Methods of Eliminating Copper from Gold Ores we see that several methods have been suggested to eliminate copper from ores prior to cyanidation.Preliminary extraction of the copper with sulphuric or sulphurous acids may be applicable to ores containing oxidized copper minerals such as malachite,azurite and chrysocolla but these acids have but little effect on sulphide copper.Gold extraction WikipediaGold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.
