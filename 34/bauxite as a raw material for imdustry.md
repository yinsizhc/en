## Industry Location Factors
Raw materials The factory needs to be close to these if they are heavy and bulky to transport.Labour A large cheap labour force is required for labour intensive manufacturing industries.High tech industries have to locate where suitable skilled workers are available.Energy supply This is needed to work the machines in a factory.Early.About Aluminium TomagoIt is found in the form of aluminium oxide in an ore called bauxite.Alumina and bauxite are the two main raw materials in the aluminium making process.

## Alumina and Bauxite Market Size & Share Industry,
Bauxite is the best raw material for the production of metallic aluminum,and it is also the most important application field The amount of bauxite is more than 90% of the total output of bauxite in the worldAluminum oxide,chemical formula Al2O3 It is a high hardness compound with a melting point of 2054&#176;C and a boiling point of 2980&#176;CThe Impact of Metal Extraction to the Environment,…One of the growing concerns right now is the increasingly worsening condition of our environment.If you read and listen to environment news,you will not just worry but be scared of all the things that could potentially go wrong once we've exhausted our natural resources.One natural resource that is in high demand is metal.The increasing need for this element has made companies extract more.

Mar 11,2019 · Bauxite ore contains 30 60% aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3).In the Bayer process (Figure 2),the bauxite is digested in a pressure vessel along with a sodium hydroxide solution (caustic soda) at an elevated temperature,which dissolves the aluminum oxide converting it into sodium aluminate,leaving insoluble red mud solids as a by product.Alumina and Bauxite Market Size,Industry Trends AndBauxite and alumina are primarily consumed in the manufacturing of aluminum.However,owing to their distinct physical and chemical properties,they are used in a variety of other appliions.Calcined alumina,a synthetic corundum of bauxite,is extensive used as an abrasive material in polishing material and sand papers.

## A Comparison between Andalusite and Bauxite as Refractory.
Compared to bauxite as a refractory raw material,andalusite offers the following advantages: An andalusite crystal remains stable even after firing at high temperature and therefore,does not require any preparatory firing before use whereas raw Bauxite requires calcination at 1600 1650°C to make it suitable to be used as refractory raw material.Mining and Refining Bauxite Residue UtilisationCalcium sulfo aluminate type cements require a higher alumina content that Portland cement and bauxite is frequently used as the alumina source with the result that their raw material cost is markedly higher The use of bauxite residue offers the opportunity for reducing this cost differential
