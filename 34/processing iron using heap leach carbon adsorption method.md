## Heap leaching Wikipedia
Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re separate them after their division from other earth materials.Similar to in situ mining,heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner,then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the.a mathematical model for isothermal heap and column leachingresults for two case studies,namely,an industrial gold heap leaching and a pilot column copper acid leaching,showed many years as an effective method to recovery recovery step (by precipitation or by adsorption on activated carbon).Similarly,in the column leaching process,the solid particles are carefully disposed.

## Precious Metal Recovery Methods
For both milling and heap leaching operations,carbon adsorption has been the preferred method of gold recovery over the last five years,with the notable exception of high silver ores and a few other specific applications (see Zinc Precipitation section).Improve Heap Leaching Percolation RateAgglomeration and balling of crushed ore to produce a porous and more uniform feed material for heap leaching is a potentially viable method for treating clayey ores.Little attention has been given to such methods for.improving uniform percolation flow of leach solutions through silver and gold ores.
