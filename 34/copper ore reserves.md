## Copper: smelting,producing and classification Metalpedia
Copper: smelting and classification; The smelting of copper; Copper that is mined from copper ore,after beneficiation,becomes high quality copper concentrate.Then,after being smelted,refined copper and copper products are yielded.There are two ways of smelting copper,one is pyrometallurgy,the other hydrometallurgical.The 10 biggest copper mines in the world Mining TechnologyNov 04,2013 · The Radomiro Tomic copper mine is located in the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile and is the eighth largest copper mine in the world.The open pit mine was estimated to contain 12.1Mt of fine copper (2,567Mt of ore reserve grading 0.47% copper) at the beginning of 2013.
