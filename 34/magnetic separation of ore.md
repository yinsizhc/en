## Magnetic separation of hematite and limonite fines as.
2011 3 30&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;As it is expected,the conventional magnetic separation achieved a very poor separation e?ciency for the ?ne iron ore,produced a concentrate assaying 41% Fe with 43% recovery.Obviously,most of the iron loss was due to the weak magnetic force on hematite ?nes,resulting in that the ?nes past straight through the separation box of the magnetic separator and thus were collected as tailings.What is an example of a magnetic separation AnswersApr 18,2012 · Magnetic separation is technique used in metallurgyfor the concentration of ore particles.The principle of this method is that the magnetic ore particles can be separated from non magnetic.
