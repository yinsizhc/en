Assessing shale mineral composition: From lab to seismic scale.Here,we introduce a novel workflow combining seismic data,well logs and laboratory measurements to infer shale composition at.Siltstone Properties,Composition,Formation,Uses.Color: Shale is commonly dark because of the lithic content,dark clay minerals,and carbonaceous matter,which is frequently a constituent of shale.The dark color of shale is usually indicative of marine origin.Marine shale dominates in frequency,areal distribution,and thickness.

## Geology rocks and minerals
Slate Slate is a low grade metamorphic rock generally formed by the metamorphosis of mudstone shale,or sometimes basalt,under relatively low pressure and temperature conditions.Clay minerals in the parent rock metamorphose into mica minerals ( biotote,chlorite,muscovite) which are aligned along foliation planes perpendicular to the direction of pressure.Minerals,Rocks & Rock Forming ProcessesThe softer and less stable minerals (hornblende,pyroxene,olivine) are absent or at least fairly rare.Even though the mineral composition of a sandstone does not give us lots of direct clues as to the source rock composition,we can gain some insight into climate and transport history from the mineral composition of a sandstone.
