## Plasma heated furnace for iron ore pellet induration.
 · In the face of shrinking world reserves of high grade iron ore,low grade ores are used,which must be concentrated before further processing.The concentrated iron ore fines obtained cannot be used as such,for example in a blast furnace to produce pig iron or to produce sponge iron in a direct reduction iron plant (DRI).Novel Adsorbent from Iron Ore Concentration Tailings …A novel adsorbent (FB mZVI) was prepared,using tailings from iron ore concentration plants,fly ash and bentonite,to remove crystal violet (CV) and methylene blue (MB) from polluted water.The adsorbent was prepared as cylindrical shape pellets to easily separate it from the water after the adsorption process.
