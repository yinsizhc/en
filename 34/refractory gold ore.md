## Redox potential measurement during pressure oxidation (POX) of a refractory gold ore
ABSTRACTPressure oxidation (POX) leaching has been commercially applied to refractory gold ores since the 1980s.In the process,sulphide material is oxidised and dissolved in order to release the gold encapsulated in the sulphide matrix,making the gold available for further recovery.Treatment of carbonaceous refractory gold ores ResearchGateGold ores can be categorized into two types free milling and refractory.Free milling ores are those easy to process by simple gravity techniques or direct cyanidation.Refractory ores,on the other hand,are difficult to treat and require pre cyanidation processes to liberate the gold.Underlying.

## Refractory gold. Free Online Library
Refractory gold ore is generally defined as ore containing gold which cannot be satisfactorily recovered by basic gravity concentration or by simple cyanidation.To put numbers to it,ores that yield gold recoveries of less than 80% when using CIL or cyanidation are refractory.Such ores are typically pyritic,arsenopyritic,and carbonaceous.
