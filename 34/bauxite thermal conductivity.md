## Gallium Wikipedia
Gallium is a chemical element with the symbol Ga and atomic number 31.Elemental gallium is a soft,silvery blue metal at standard temperature and pressure; however in its liquid state it becomes silvery white.If too much force is applied,the gallium may fracture conchoidally.It is in group 13 of the periodic table,and thus has similarities to the other metals of the group,aluminium,indium.Oni Assistant Aluminum OreThermal conductivity is how quickly heat moves through the element as a medium.You would want low conductivity when insulating your base,but high conductivity when transferring heat to be deleted.
