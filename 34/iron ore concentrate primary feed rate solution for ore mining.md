## Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores IspatGuru
Mar 28,2015 · Processes for Beneficiation of Iron Ores Iron is an abundant element in the earth's crust averaging from 2 % to 3 % in sedimentary rocks to 8.5 % in basalt and gabbro.Because iron is present in many areas,it is of relatively low value and thus a deposit must have a high percentage of metal to be considered ore grade.Ernest Henry Mining: Magnetite ProcessingMining (EHM) orebody The EHM orebody is an iron oxide copper gold (IOCG) deposit with magnetite being the form of iron ore.EHM's Ore Reserve Estimate at 30 June 2010 is 88 million tonnes at a grade of 1% copper,0.5 grams per tonne gold and 23% magnetite.In 2010,EHM produced 74,595 tonnes of copper in concentrate and 91,259 ounces
