## Coal Drying Improves Performance and Reduces Emissions
coal is pulverized and dried.Dryer coal is easier to pulverize,and less mill power is needed to achieve the same coal fineness.Additionally,with less fuel moisture,more complete drying of coal can be achieved in the mill.This results in increased mill exit temperature (the temperature of the coal and primary air mixture at mill exit.Pulverised Coal Combustion with higher efficiency.Pulverised coal power plants account for about 97% of the world's coal fired capacity (IEA 2008,p.225).The average net efficiency (energy produced minus energy used within the plant) is around 35%,which means that 35% of the energy in one unit of coal is transferred into electricity.

## Coal dust Wikipedia
Coal dust is a fine powdered form of coal,which is created by the crushing,grinding,or pulverizing of coal.Because of the brittle nature of coal,coal dust can be created during mining,transportation,or by mechanically handling coal.It is a form of fugitive dust.Grinding coal to dust before combusting it improves the speed and efficiency of burning and makes the coal easier to handle.How it Works: Crushers,Grinding Mills and Pulverizers.Crushers,grinding mills and pulverizers are types of grinding equipment used to transform or reduce a coarse material such as stone,coal,or slag into a smaller,finer material.Grinding equipment can be classified into to two basic types,crushers and grinders.
