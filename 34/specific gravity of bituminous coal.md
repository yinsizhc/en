Coal Density an overview ScienceDirect Topics.Coal Density.Coal density should be determined from average specific gravity of various coal rank as in 1.29 for lignite coal,1.30 for subbituminous coal,1.32 for bituminous coal,and 1.47 for anthracite and semianthracite coal.Specific Gravity Of General Materials TableThe specific gravity of all other materials are compared to water as a fraction heavier or fraction lighter density,no matter how small or large the fraction is.For example,ammonium nitrate has a specific gravity (sg) of 0.73 while dry ammonium sulphate has a sg of 1.13 (1130 kilograms cubic meter).
