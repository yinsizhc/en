## Uranium: How is it Mined? New Mexico Institute of Mining.
Open pit mining,also known as strip mining,is the removal of surficial soils and uneconomic rock to get at the ore below.Ore grades are normally less than 0.5%.This is type of mining is only possible if the uranium ore is near the surface (normally less than 400 ft).Mining Techniques for Sand & Gravel SciencingThe U.S.Environmental Protection Agency describes sand and gravel as granulated material that results "from the natural disintegration of rock or stone." The deposits of these materials are generally near the surface of the Earth and in wet areas.The locations are suitable for open pit mining and dredging.
