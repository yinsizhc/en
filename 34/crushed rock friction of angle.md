## Angle of repose and internal friction ScienceDirect
The relation between angle of repose and angle of internal friction in a fragmented mass is discussed,and experiments with crushed rocks are reported.It is concluded that the angle of repose is not generally the angle of internal friction of the material in the pile,but of the same material in a more closely packed condition.Friction angle of rock AnswersFormal answer: The angle of internal friction is measure of the ability of a material (could be rock or soil or whatever) to withstand a shear stress.It is the angle (φ),measured between the.
