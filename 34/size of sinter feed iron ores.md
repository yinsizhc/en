## Ore Sintering an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Like other sintering processes,iron ore sintering converts iron ore fines of often − 8 mm sizing into larger agglomerates,namely,sinter,between 5 and 50 mm particle size,which possess the physical and metallurgical characteristics and gas permeability required for efficient blast furnace operation.As shown in Figure 14.1,iron ore sintering is carried out in three stages: raw material..::SAIL::.STEEL MAKING PROCESSDifferent types of Rolling Mills tailor make steel products,in terms of size,shape and.Iron ore,lumps sinter pellet and coke are fed in Blast Furnace from top.Fine particles of iron ore and coke are pre treated before feeding them to Blast.
