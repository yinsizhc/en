Climb and conventional Climb Conventional There are two methods for the milling operation climb milling and conventional milling.For many years it was common practice to mill against the direction of the feed due to the absence of backlash eliminating devices and the use of high speed steel cutters.This method is called conventional milling.climb vs.conventional cutting Vectric ForumMar 14,2014 · I did some comparisons in poplar (which is kind of soft and fibrous) with an upcut and a downcut solid carbide end mill as well as a ball end plunge bit (straight brazed flutes).For all these bits the conventional mode gave much better results,quite smooth,no sanding required.The climb cut was not torn out but very fuzzy.
