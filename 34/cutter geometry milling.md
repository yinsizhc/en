## Tom's Techniques Reference
The nose radius should be kept around 1 64″ for steel and 1 32″ or so for non ferrous metals.If it's too small,it will burn out quickly on steel,too large and it will chatter.Fly cutters dissipate heat better than end mills,so I generally run them 30% 50% faster than an end mill of equal size.Cutting force prediction in milling CFRPs with complex.Starting with a CAD model,the complex cutter geometry was discretized into disk cutters of finite thickness and a generalized mechanistic milling force model was then developed at the basic level of the individual teeth on each disk.The proposed method was applied for predicting the milling forces for unidirectional CFRP laminates.

## End mill Wikipedia
An end mill is a type of milling cutter,a cutting tool used in industrial milling applications.It is distinguished from the drill bit in its application,geometry,and manufacture.While a drill bit can only cut in the axial direction,a milling bit can generally cut in all directions,though some cannot cut axially.Cutting Tool GeometriesThe pitch of a milling cutter refers to the number of inserts it holds in relation to its diameter.The coarser the pitch (fewer cutting inserts),the larger the chip gullet,which provides room for the chip as the cutter passes through a workpiece.Milling cutters may have coarse,fine,or extra fine pitches.
