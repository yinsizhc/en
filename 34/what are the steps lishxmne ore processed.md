## The 6 Steps To Modern Steel Production Explained Metro Steel
With this in mind,here are the 6 steps to modern steel production explained.Step 1 The iron making process.As iron is the main component of steel it firstly needs to be made.Iron ore,lime,and coke are placed into a blast furnace and melted.The resulting liquid known as molten iron is then formed.WHAT IS STEEL MAKING PROCESS: BRIEFLY EXPLAIN STEEL FEELJun 21,2016 · Steel making is the method of processing and producing steel from iron ore and scrap.It focuses on removing the slugs and other unwanted materials like phosphorus,sulphur,silicon,nitrogen,and excess carbon from the raw iron.The next step targets on alloying it by adding various elements like manganese,chromium,nickel,and vanadium.
