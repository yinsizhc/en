## Underground Mining Methods
The choice of an underground mining method depends on a range of factors and these include; the size and shape of the deposit,the orientation or slope of the deposit,the depth of the deposit,geological structures,characteristics of the ore and the surrounding rocks and issues with gas and water.In combination,these factors allow us to determine an appropriate arrangement and sequence for.Mining for Minerals 1000 Feet Underground YouTubeNov 23,2016&#0183;&#32;Follow BLM staff as they tour a lead mine in southeastern Missouri The Doe Run mining complex consists of several mines,and federal mineral leases administered by,

Surface mining is a form of mining in which the soil and the rock covering the mineral deposits are removed.It is the other way of underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left behind,and the required mineral deposits are removed through shafts or tunnels.Surface mining is basically employed when deposits of commercially viable minerals or rock are found closer to the surface.Mining and Mineral Use Earth ScienceUnderground Mining.Underground mining is used to recover ores that are deeper into Earth's surface.Miners blast and tunnel into rock to gain access to the ores.How underground mining is approached from above,below,or sideways depends on the placement of the ore body,its depth,concentration of ore,and the strength of the.
