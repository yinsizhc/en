## How to Use Bleach on Gold Ore to Remove Gold Sciencing
How to Use Bleach on Gold Ore to Remove Gold.Add the 35 percent hydrochloric acid to the sodium hypochlorite bleach into a flask or beaker,in a two to one ratio of acid to bleach.Ensure that the liquid mixture is at least six times the volume of the ore grains.Wear a face mask and avoid breathing the chlorine fumes the reaction produces.Roasting (metallurgy) WikipediaRoasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.
