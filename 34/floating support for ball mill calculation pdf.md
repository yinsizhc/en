## ATTRITORS AND BALL MILLS HOW THEY WORK Robert E.
Ball mills work well on hard,brittle materials.They are not as suitable for grinding elastic,ductile or fibrous materials,or for fine grinding in general.Ball mills can blend and grind at the same time,yielding a fine,intimate mixture.Conventional ball mills are usually limited to.Mill Speed Critical SpeedMill Speed.No matter how large or small a mill,ball mill,ceramic lined mill,pebble mill,jar mill or laboratory jar rolling mill,its rotational speed is important to proper and efficient mill operation.Too low a speed and little energy is imparted on the product.
