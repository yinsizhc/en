## Volume Load thecementgrindingoffice.com
The measurement of the ball charge volume load (or filling degree) is essential to maintain the absorbed power of the mill and consequently the mill production.The most common way to evaluate the filling degree is the measurement of the free height inside the mill (vertical distance between the top of the charge and the lining in the mill axis).Volume 3 Issue 4 IJERA.comInternational Journal of Engineering Research and Applications (IJERA) is an open access online peer reviewed international journal that publishes research.

## Ball Mills
Ball Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back intoBall MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
