## 30 Construction Material Testing Techniques Structural Guide
Aggregate Crushing Value (ACV) The aggregate crushing value is a relative measure of the resistance of an aggregate to crushing under a gradually applied compressive load.It is defined as percentage by weight of the crushed material obtained when the test aggregates are subjected to a specified load under stabilized conditions.ASTM C128scope: This test method covers the determination of relative density (specific gravity) and the absorption of fine aggregates.The relative density (specific gravity),a dimensionless quality,is expressed as oven dry (OD),saturated surface dr y (SSD),or as apparent relative density (specific gravity).The OD relative density is determined after drying the aggregate.
