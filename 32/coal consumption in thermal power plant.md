## Power Generation Energy Efficient Design of Auxiliary.
Energy efficiency is the least expensive way for power and process industries to meet a growing demand for cleaner energy,and this applies to the power generating industry as well.In most fossil fuel steam power plants,between 7 to 15 percent of the generated power never makes it past the plant gate,as it is diverted back toEnvironmental impacts of coal SourceWatch"Third,coal consumption is far more concentrated than the use of other fossil fuels.A mere six hundred large coal burning power plants account for nearly all coal usage,in contrast to the tens of millions of cars,trucks,planes,homes,businesses,and factories that burn oil and gas.Thus,reducing emissions from coal is a far simpler task."
