## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.
The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different chemistries of the ore.Copper oxides are more abundant near the surface,but are considered low grade ore,with a lower concentration of copper.Although this requires more ore.Techniques of copper recovery from Mexican copper oxide ore.Mexican copper ore is a mixed ore containing mainly copper oxide and some.an H2SO4 concentration of 1.0 mol L and a mass ratio of the ore slurry liquid to.
