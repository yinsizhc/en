## Summary of Gold Gravity Separation
Summary of Gold Gravity Separation 1.Gold Gravity Separation Principle.Gold gravity separation refers to the gold extraction and separation process making use of different moving speed and direction of mineral with different particle sizes,traits and proportion under the combined action of gravity,centrifugal force,medium resistance and mechanical resistance.Offered ServicesGravity Separation: Gravity separation techniques are used to separate minerals of different relative densities.The dominant competing force in gravity separation is usually a fluid drag force.Pneumatic tabling and winnowing have been included as dry forms of gravity.
