## COKING COAL BENEFICIATION SciTech Connect
This difference of property is utilised in gravity separation of coal.In coal Beneficiation,artificial suspension of above mentioned densities are produced and coals are subjected to float and sink.The coals which float at 1.5 specific gravity are called clean coal and the sinks are put to another suspension of specific gravity of 1.7.HEAP LEACHING TECHNIQUE in MININGbecame feasible with introduction of heap leaching technologies (Marsden,2009).In consideration of ore types,a generalized diagram showing the applicable ore beneficiation technologies for oxide and sulphide ores versus ore grade is given in Figure 2.Figure 2 Applicable Ore Beneficiation Technologies as a Function of Ore Grade
