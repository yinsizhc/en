## Air Flow,Air Systems,Pressure,and Fan Performance
Static pressure Static pressure is the measure of the potential energy of a unit of air in the particular cross section of a duct.Air pressure on the duct wall is considered static.Imagine a fan blowing into a completely closed duct; it will create only static pressure because there is no air flow through the duct.Figure 1 Variablespeed electronic controller Solvingpressure is too high,the control loop slows the speed of the motor.If the pressure is too low,it speeds up the motor.Of course,as is the case with any closedloop system,care must be taken to ensure that the system is stable under all flow conditions,not just a few points.For diesel engines,a pressurelimiting device is added as

Liquid: Valves for liquid systems require tight seals to prevent leakage.If greater than 25% of system pressure drop is possible at maximum flow conditions,use the linear characteristic.If less than 25% of system pressure drop is available to the valve at maximum flow conditions,the equal percentage characteristic provides the best result.Over pressurized drums: Their causes and mitigation.Over pressurized drums: Their causes and mitigation.These devices come in many styles and pressure ratings (i.e.pressure at which the device will release gas).Some styles are based upon a mechanism that will reseal upon venting and are good in situations when repeated venting is to be expected.Explosion and High Pressure Hazards.
