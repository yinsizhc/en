## potassium cyanide used in gold mining
Sodium cyanide Wikipedia.Sodium gold cyanide.Sodium cyanide is used mainly to extract gold and other precious metals in mining industry.This application exploits the high affinity of gold(I) for cyanide,which induces gold metal to oxidize and dissolve in the presence of air (oxygen) and water,producing the salt sodium gold cyanide (or gold sodium cyanide) and sodium hydroxide:Gold and Silver Leaching by CyanidationIntroduction to Gold and Silver Leaching.The cyanide leaching process is the most important method ever developed for extracting gold from its ores.The early development of the process is attributed to a Scotchman,John Stewart Mac Arthur,in collaboration with the Forrest brothers.The method was introduced into South Africa in 1890.

## Six Factors Affecting Gold Leaching in Cyanide Leaching.
3.Cyanide agent dosage.Gold is a kind of inactive metal,which can cause complexation reaction with cyanogen (CN ) under the action of oxygen in the cyanide leaching process,and then results in Au (CN) 2 .Therefore,cyanide agent dosage is one of the key factors determining the gold dissolution.The Extraction of Silver Chemistry LibreTextsSilver is extracted from the ore argentite ((Ag 2S)).The process of extraction of silver is called as cyanide process as sodium cyanide solution is used.The ore is crushed,concentrated and then treated with sodium cyanide solution.This reaction forms sodium argento cyanide (Na [Ag(CN) 2]).

Silver is also leached easily using cyanide,however much silver ore is in sulfide forms,and at higher concentrations (several ounces per ton and above),so other methods such as gravity concentration and froth flotation may be employed.Information provided by Charles Kubach,Mining and Mineral Processing EngineerTHIOSULPHATE LEACHING AN ALTERNATIVE TO.as unconsumed catalysts in the reaction.One possible scheme for the overall reaction is presented below: 4Au + 8S 2 O 3 2 + O 2 + 2H 2 O → 4Au (S 2 O 3) 2 3 + 4OH While it is relatively easy,in just a few tests,to establish the amenability of an ore to cyanide leaching and optimize the process,the thiosulphate chemistry
