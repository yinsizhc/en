## Steelmaking: The Coke Oven By Product Plant
the process of converting coal into coke using the by product coke oven,the volatile matter in the coal is vaporized and driven off.This volatile matter leaves the coke oven chambers as hot,raw coke oven gas.After leaving the coke oven chambers,the raw coke oven gas isDifference Between Coal and Coke DifferenceBetween.com• Coke is produced from bituminous coal.• Coke burns with no smoke whereas coal burns with smoke.Therefore,coke is better as a fuel than bituminous coal itself.• Therefore,coke is used as a substitute for coal in domestic environments.• Water content in coke goes t zero at the end of the coking process,but coal contains water.
