## Ball Mill Breakage & Liberation Kinetics
Although the construction of simulation models for ball mills has proved very useful for analysis and design of mill circuits,there is one important application where the state of the art is still at a very preliminary stage.This is the prediction of the liberation of valuable components from gangue as the material passes through the mill circuit.Models to cover this case must be developed.ABOUT US MEGA MILLING & MINING TECHNOLOGYThe MEGA MILLING & MINING GOLD MAXX Turbulent Impact Mill (T.I.M.) is an innovative and commercialized method for particle size reduction to reduce,within seconds,solids that are capable of fracturing into a particle sized powder! The GOLD MAXX T.I.M.reduces hard rock ores into particle sized powder of 200 400 mesh.It replaces a conventional ball mill,impact mill,hammer mill,tower.
