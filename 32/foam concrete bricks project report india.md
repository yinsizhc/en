## What is Lightweight Concrete? Types,Uses and Advantages
What is Lightweight Concrete? Lightweight concrete mixture is made with a lightweight coarse aggregate and sometimes a portion or entire fine aggregates may be lightweight instead of normal aggregates.Structural lightweight concrete has an in place density (unit weight) on the order of 90 to 115 lb ft³ (1440 to 1840 kg m³).Specification and Quality Control of Light Weight Foam,Further quality of foam concrete is depending upon the quality and type of foam is used As mostly no coarse aggregate is used in the production of the foam concrete or cellular concrete,the correct terms would be called mortar instead of concrete The density of foam concrete generally varies from 800 1600kg m3
