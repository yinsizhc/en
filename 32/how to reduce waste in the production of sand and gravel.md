## Environmental Sustainability Boston Sand And Gravel
Boston Sand & Gravel's Charlestown facility not only operates with an active environmental management system to ensure regulatory compliance but it is also on a journey toward environmental sustainability,which began a decade ago.Sand and Gravel (Aggregate): Portland Cement: Concrete.Asphalt Production: Asphalt production uses Aggregate along with liquid asphalt (oil).As with concrete there are other chemicals added to reduce stripping (oil not sticking to the sand and gravel) and produce a longer lifespan.Again,a discussion for another day.Once the sand,gravel and oil are combined we add heat and have asphalt.
