The phrase speeds and feeds or feeds and speeds refers to two separate velocities in machine tool practice,cutting speed and feed rateThey are often considered as a pair because of their combined effect on the cutting process Each,however,can also be considered and analyzed in its own rightFeed rate optimization and depth of cut control for.The average feed rate provided a basis to compare whether the minimized cost function improved the parallelism.Finally,the machine made a pass at the average feed rate,but with no control in the Z direction.Three replications were performed for both the optimal feed rate and the average feed rate,both using vertical axis control.

## 10 Things to Know About Creep Feed Grinding : …
Compensating for the heavy depth of cut in creep feed is a traverse rate (feed rate) that is low,often on the order of 5 to 20 inches per minute.The low feed rate and corresponding chip load mean the cutting force upon every individual grit of the surface of the grinding wheel is also low.Thrufeed centerless OD grinding: Parameter …2020 2 29&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The purpose of the grinding wheel is to remove material from the workpiece and improve part OD quality.The regulating wheel acts like a brake,controlling the rotational speed and thrufeed rate of the workpeice.An angular topped workrest blade supports the workpiece as it passes through the grinder between the grinding and regulating wheels.
