The jet mill design incorporates a grinding zone at the bottom of the mill.The classification zone is located in the top section of the mill.Feed material is introduced to the mill through a top gravity feed inlet.These mills work by accelerating gas through a nozzle directed to a central focal point.Unit 2: Speeds,Feeds,and Tapping Manufacturing.Manufacturing Processes 4 5.3 Unit 2: Speeds,Feeds,and Tapping.Feed per tooth,is the amount of material that should be removed by each tooth of the cutter as it revolves and advances into the work.(Vertical Mill) Power feed tapping is similar to hand tapping.Instead of tapping by hand,however,use the vertical mill to tap the.
