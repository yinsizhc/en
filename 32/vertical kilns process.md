The vertical shaft kiln is a high temperature processing unit in the production of deadburned magnesia [1,2].After raw magnesite (MgCO3) is processed through a multiple heart furnace and converted into calcined magnesite (MgO) or clinker,it is further processed through vertical shaft kilns where densification or deadburned process occurs atCement kiln WikipediaPlants that burn waste fuels enjoy a negative fuel cost (they are paid by industries needing to dispose of materials that have energy content and can be safely disposed of in the cement kiln thanks to its high temperatures and longer retention times).As a result,the inefficiency of the wet process is an advantage—to the manufacturer.
