FROM IRON ORE TO IRON SINTER PROCESS CONTROL USING X RAY DIFFRACTION (XRD)* Uwe König1 Nicholas Norberg2 Luciano Gobbo3 Abstract Traditionally quality control of iron ore sinter,its raw materials and raw mixtures has relied on time consuming wet chemistry.The mineralogical composition that defines the properties is often not monitored.Mining of Iron Ores IspatGuru · Most of the large iron ore mines are mechanized mines.In these mining is done to extract iron ore from surface deposits.In these mines all the operations are mechanized and mining is invariably done through systematic formation of benches by drilling and blasting.Mining process.The recovery of material is done from an open pit in the ground.
