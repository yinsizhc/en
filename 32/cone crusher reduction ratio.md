## Gyratory Crusher
The gyratory crushers crush to reduce the size by a maximum of about one tenth its size.Usually,metallurgical operations require greater size reduction; hence,the products from the primary crushers are conveyed to secondary or cone crushers where further reduction in size takes place.Here,the maximumreduction ratio for cone crusher,pdfreduction ratio for cone crusher A general rule of thumb for applying Cone Crushers is the reduction ratio.A crusher with coarse style liners would typically have a 6:1 reduction ratio.Thus,with a 3⁄4” closed side setting,the maximum feed would be 6 x 3⁄4 or 4.5.
