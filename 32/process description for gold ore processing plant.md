## Mineral Processing
The process of extracting gold from sulphide ore begins when the trucks deliver the ore from the blast site to the ROM (run of mine) pad at the Fimiston Plant.Here the crusher reduces it to chunks of rock about the size of a fist.Gold CIL processThe gold CIL process is mainly used in the oxide ore which has low grade of silver,its more economize and has more benefit.Process introduction CIL process is mainly include : decontaminate,concentrate before leaching,leaching and adsorption,desorption and electrowinning,hydrometallurgy,regeneration of activated carbon ， tailings filting,waste water treatement and so on.
