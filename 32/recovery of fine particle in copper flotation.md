Fine particle flotation.[Tatu Miettinen; Ian Wark Research Institute (S.Aust.)] The recovery of fine particles has become of great importance during recent years,since the demand for minerals is increasing and the extent of available ore is decreasing.To recover fine particles.The development of regrind flotation pre treatment of the.Abstract This study focused on the development of a new method,regrind flotation pre treatment,to improve the performance of the CIL (Carbon in Leach) circuit at copper gold concentrators.Occlusion of gold by iron sulphide gangue minerals and the fine grain size of gold associated with them contribute to the low gold recovery in the CIL circuit.
