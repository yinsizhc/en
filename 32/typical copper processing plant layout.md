Heap leaching is an industrial mining process used to extract precious metals,copper,uranium,and other compounds from ore using a series of chemical reactions that absorb specific minerals and re separate them after their division from other earth materials.Similar to in situ mining,heap leach mining differs in that it places ore on a liner,then adds the chemicals via drip systems to the.Metallurgy & Mineral Processing SRKThe building blocks for plant design the process streams water,reagent and utilities and identify each piece,a typical flotation flowsheet might include rougher flotation followed by scavenger,process that is used to recover a vast array of different minerals containing valuable commodities such as copper,lead,zinc,nickel.
