## Chemical Admixtures cementorg
Certain admixtures,such as pigments,expansive agents,and pumping aids are used only in extremely small amounts and are usually batched by hand from premeasured containers The effectiveness of an admixture depends on several factors including: type and amount of cement,water content,mixing time,slump,and temperatures of the concrete and air4 TYPES OF CHEMICAL ADMIXTURES FOR CONCRETE …Chemical admixture was first used in 1930s for entraining air into concrete to increase its frost resistance.The fine air bubbles with a close spacing provide partial relief as the liquid phase in concrete progressively freezes.Dodson (1990) clarified that air entraining admixtures (AEA) do not generate air in the concrete.Their function is.
