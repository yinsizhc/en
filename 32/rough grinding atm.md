## Stellafane ATM: Rough Grinding
For rough grinding a 6" mirror,about 1 2 teaspoon of grit is used per wet.With finer grits,proportionately less grit is used per wet.Grits in the25 micron range are often premixed with water to form a slurry,and water and grit are squirted onto the work together from a plastic squeeze bottle (not a …Stellafane ATM: Fine GrindingHogging out,or rough grinding,removed a lot of glass in a short time with very coarse grit,but that left a very rough surface behind.Fine grinding,and later polishing,has as a major goal to smooth that surface through a series of successive refinements.The criteria for switching grits,therefore,is:
