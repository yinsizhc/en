## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes.
The various advantages of iron ore pellets are given below.Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production.Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).iron ore fines plant techniquesIron ore is used directly in the steelmaking process in the blast furnace in the form of lump,pellet,and fines (see Fig.5).(Fines are converted to sinter feed in a sinter plant.) Iron ore pellets are also used in the production of DRI and HBI.Sinter plant Wikipedia
