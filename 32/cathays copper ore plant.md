## Copper Leaching Method Metallurgist & Mineral Processing.
Extraction of copper from suitable ore by leaching methods is generally assumed to cost less than the combined expense of concentration,smelting,and refining,and experimental data tend to confirm this opinion.At the Butte Duluth plant,which is handling in excess of 100 tons of oxidized ore daily,the copper is said to cost 0.085 per pound.Copper For The Garden: What Copper Does For PlantsCopper is an essential element for plant growth.Soils naturally contain copper in some form or other,ranging anywhere from 2 to 100 parts per million (ppm) and averaging at about 30 ppm.Most plants contain about 8 to 20 ppm.Without adequate copper,plants will fail to grow properly.Therefore.
