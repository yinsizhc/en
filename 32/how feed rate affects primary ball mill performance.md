## Ball mill
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Milling Process,Defects,EquipmentMilling machines can be found in a variety of sizes and designs,yet they still possess the same main components that enable the workpiece to be moved in three directions relative to the tool.These components include the following: Base and column The base of a milling machine is simply the platform that sits on the ground and supports the machine.
