## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Copper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.Innovations: Introduction to Copper: Mining & ExtractionThe barren rock,or gangue has to be separated from the sulfide minerals in order to smelt the metallic copper from the ore.By far the greatest proportion of copper is extracted from the sulfides of copper,iron and sometimes other metals.Such ores originate from sulfur bearing volcanic magmas,which have separated into metal sulfides and siliceous melts.
