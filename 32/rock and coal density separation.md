Float sink tests are done on samples of coal from beds that will likely need washing (beneficiation,preparation) to remove sulfur or ash (rock and mineral matter) from the coal …Liquid Chromatographic Separation of Sediment,Rock,and.A method is described for the rapid fractionation of sediment,rock,and coal extracts and crude oils into compound classes.The method is based on combined polarity affinity chromatography of soluble organic matter.Five heterocompound fractions are obtained in addition to the conventional saturated and aromatic hydrocarbon fractions.Model compound studies show that those fractions are.
