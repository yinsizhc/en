## Ways to Separate Metal From Ore Sciencing
The process of separating a metal from its ore is known as smelting.Smelting is widely practiced today and has a long history dating back to the Bronze Age,when ancient peoples first learned the technique.Smelting methods range from the basic to the high tech,and are applied to a variety of materials,including aluminum,iron and copper.Dry Iron Ore Beneficiation Iron Ore SeparationIron ore extraction is mainly performed through open pit mining operations,resulting in significant tailings generation.The iron ore production system usually involves three stages: Mynbou,processing and pelletizing activities.Of these,processing ensures that an adequate iron grade and chemistry is achieved prior to the pelletizing stage.
