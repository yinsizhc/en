## Using Rock Phosphate For Gardens What Does Rock.
What is Rock Phosphate? Rock phosphate,or phosphorite,is mined from clay deposits that contain phosphorus and is used to make organic phosphate fertilizers that many gardeners utilize.In the past,rock phosphate was used alone as a fertilizer,but due to a lack in supply,as well as low concentration,most applied fertilizer is processed.Hard water affects phosphate functionality in injected.Jan 26,2014 · Whereas not everyone in the U.S.deals with hard water supplies,most regions have hard water problems,and the hard water is not always due to calcium.Iron and magnesium are also causes of water hardness.Different phosphates respond differently to the different types of cations that are causing hardness in water supplies.
