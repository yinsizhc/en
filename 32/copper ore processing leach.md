## From Ore to Finished Product Copper
Copper From Beginning to End.Copper is a major metal and an essential element used by man.It is found in ore deposits around the world.It is also the oldest metal known to man and was first discovered and used about 10,000 years ago.And as alloyed in bronze (copper tin alloy) about 3000 BC,was the first engineering material known to man.gold leaching flotation separator cooper ore processing. · In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated Water quality,flotation equipment size and type,temperature,and ore body variation are Gold,silver,copper,lead,zinc,molybdenum,iron,potash,phosphate,and even Oxide copper minerals are very soluble in the leach solution.

## Processing of chalcopyrite ore by heap leaching and.
Copper leaching from chalcopyrite ore was not influenced by the irrigation rate or by the acid concentration in the feed solution.whereby the high metal values remaining in the partially leached residues are a valuable feed for conventional mineral processing.If the copper recovery in the leaching step were too high,the residual copper.Copper Mining and Extraction: Sulfide OresOres near the surface can be quarried after removal of the surface layers.The ore is treated with dilute sulfuric acid.This trickles slowly through the ore dissolving copper to form copper sulfate.The copper is recovered by electrolytic refining.Advantages of this process are: See for further information on the leaching process.
