## IRON AND STEEL
2020 2 26&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;This page looks at the use of the Blast Furnace in the extraction of iron from iron ore,and the conversion of the raw iron from the furnace into various kinds of steel.The common ores of iron are both iron oxides,and these can be reduced to iron by heating them with carbon in the form of coke.Extraction of Iron from its ores,Iron dressing,…Iron ( 26 Fe: (18 Ar),4S 2,3d 6 ) is found in the earth’s crust in the form of natural ores which contains different iron oxides mixed with impurities such as Silica (SiO 2),(Al 2 O 3),CaO,and MgO,and some harmful impurities such as s,p and As,The suitability of the ore in the extraction of iron economically depends on three factors which are: The iron percentage in the ore.

## EXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE reduction …
EXTRACTION OF IRON IN A BLAST FURNACE Iron is also below carbon in the reactivity series,so therefore carbon can be used to reduce it (note: reduction can also mean to remove the oxygen from a compound).This is done in a blast furnace.The most common ore of iron is called haematite (iron(iii) oxide).Its formula is Fe 2 O 3.Extraction of Chromium from Chromite OreThe average grade of the metallurgical chromite ore was 43.4 pct Cr2O3,with 52 pct of the ore having a chromium to iron ratio of 3:1 or over,17.6 pct having a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1,and 30.4 pct having a ratio less than 2:1.Chemical grade chromite ore generally ranged from 40 to 46 pct Cr2O3 with a chromium to iron ratio of 1.5:1 to 2:1.
