## What are sedimentary rocks?
Metamorphic rocks started out as some other type of rock,but have been substantially changed from their original igneous,sedimentary,or earlier metamorphic form.Metamorphic rocks form when rocks are subjected to high heat,high pressure,hot mineral rich fluids or,more commonly,some combination of.Top 7 Differences Between Sedimentary Rocks and Igneous RocksMost sedimentary rocks contain either quartz (especially siliciclastic rocks) or calcite (especially carbonate rocks).In contrast with igneous and metamorphic rocks,a sedimentary rocks usually contains very few different major minerals.However,the origin of the minerals in a sedimentary rock is often more complex than those in an igneous rock.

## List of rock types Wikipedia
The following is a list of rock types recognized by geologists.There is no agreed number of specific types of rocks.Any unique combination of chemical composition,mineralogy,grain size,texture,or other distinguishing characteristics can describe a rock type.Common Sedimentary Minerals2020 2 23&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Thus,of the eight common igneous minerals,only quartz,K feldspar,and muscovite are commonly seen in sedimentary rocks.These minerals are joined in sedimentary rocks by clay minerals,calcite,dolomite,gypsum,and halite.The clay minerals form during mineral weathering.The other four minerals are salts that precipitate as water evaporates.

Igneous rocks (from the Greek word for fire) form when hot,molten rock crystallizes and solidifies.The melt originates deep within the Earth near active plate boundaries or hot spots,then rises toward the surface.Igneous rocks are divided into two groups,intrusive or extrusive,depending upon where the molten rock solidifies.List of rock types Simple English Wikipedia,the free.Sorted by name; initial letter means Igneous,Sedimentary or Metamorphic rocks.A I Andesite an intermediate volcanic rock M Anthracite a form of hard coal B S Banded iron formation a fine grained chemical sedimentary rock composed of iron oxide minerals S Bauxite the main ore of aluminium.
