## Ore processing Waihi Gold
Ore is stockpiled (1) at the processing plant,and the process begins by feeding the ore into a hopper with a loader.The ore is conveyed,and lime is added (2) to raise the pH of the ore.Following crushing through a jaw crusher (3),the ore is fed into the semi autogenous grinding.How to Take the Impurities out of Gold LEAFtvThe lead combines with other metals and forms oxide compounds that separate from the gold.This process works best with small quantities of gold ore.Submerge the unrefined gold in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids.This method will dissolve the ore and separate the gold from the impurities,which can later be washed away.

## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.Extracting Gold HowStuffWorksRemoving the gold bearing rock from the ground is just the first step.To isolate pure gold,mining companies use a complex extraction process.The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces.At a mill,large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.
