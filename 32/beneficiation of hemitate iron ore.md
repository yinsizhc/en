Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).The iron ore,usually,very rich in iron oxides (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3).Iron ores are mostly dark grey to rusty red in color and high specific gravity.Iron ore27&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Lower grade sources of iron ore generally require beneficiation,using techniques like crushing,milling,gravity or heavy media separation,screening,and silica froth flotation to improve the concentration of the ore and remove impurities.The results,high quality fine ore powders,are known as fines.Magnetite.Magnetite is magnetic,and hence easily separated from the gangue minerals and.
