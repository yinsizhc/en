Economists use the model of aggregate demand and aggregate supply to analyse economic fluctuations.On the vertical axis is the overall level of prices.On the horizontal axis is the economy's total output of goods and services.Output and the price level adjust to the point at which the aggregate supply and aggregate demand curves intersect.1.3 The Income Expenditure ModelIn the income expenditure model,total output responds to the demand for it.In other word,aggregate supply is driven by aggregate demand.( Not all models.
