## Anthracite Coal Characteristics and Applications
Anthracite is considered “nonclinkering” and free burning because when it is ignited it does not "coke" or expand and fuse together.It is most often burned in underfeed stoker boilers or single retort side dump stoker boilers with stationary grates.Dry bottom furnaces are used because of anthracite's high ash fusion temperature.Advancing R GAS™ Entrained Flow Coal Gasification at.The installation will be located at the largest coal to chemicals plant in Shanxi Province.Construction is underway and commissioning is anticipated in 2019.The project follows up successful long duration testing of high ash fusion temperature coal using GTI’s R GAS gasifier technology at our pilot scale facility in Des Plaines,IL.
