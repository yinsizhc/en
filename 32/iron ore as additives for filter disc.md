(with picture)Mar 06,2020 · Sintered steel is a type of metal that has undergone a sintering process,in which powdered metal is heated below its melting point until the particles form a molecular bond.Metals such as iron,copper,and aluminum are commonly turned into sintered steel.Sintered steels normally possess resistance to high temperature and slow deformation rate.
