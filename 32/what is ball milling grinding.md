## How to Improve Ball Mill Grinding
22&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Functional performance analysis of ball milling has been described previously by Mclvor.“Coarse” versus “fine” or product particle cut off size is first selected,usually equal to some benchmark passing size of the circuit product (e.g.80%).The function of the grinding circuit is to generate new product size material (or “fines”) from “coarse” particles in the circuit feed.Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball MillToday we will learn about difference between sag mill vs ball mill.A mill is a machine by which solid or hard materials are broken into smaller pieces by means of grinding,crushing or cutting.This commutation is an essential part of many processes.Various kinds of mills are there with which different material processing takes place.

## Ball Mills
A Ball Mill grinds material by rotating a cylinder with steel grinding balls,causing the balls to fall back into the cylinder and onto the material to be ground.The rotation is usually between 4 to 20 revolutions per minute,depending upon the diameter of the mill.Effect of ball and feed particle size distribution on the.In this article,alternative forms of optimizing the milling efficiency of a laboratory scale ball mill by varying the grinding media size distribution and the feed material particle size distribution were investigated.Silica ore was used as the test material.
