## Suitability of Quarry Dust as Partial Replacement Material
In the presence of silica fume or fly ash,quarry dust can be a suitable partial replacement material to sand to produce concretes with fair ranges of compressive strength (Raman et al.2015Effect of quarry rock dust on the flexural strength of.The flexural strength of concrete made with quarry dust as fine aggregate is higher (about 4.3%) than conventional river sand concrete.2.The 10 15% rule of thumb was found to be applicable in the estimation of flexural strength of quarry sand concrete based on its compressive strength.

## Study on Compressive Strength of Quarry Dust as Fine
The concept of replacement of natural fine aggregate by quarry dust which is highlighted in the study could boost the consumption of quarry dust generated from quarries.By replacement of quarry dust,the requirement of land fill area can be reduced and can also solve the problem of natural sand scarcity.The availability of sand at low cost as a fine aggregate in concrete is not suitable andUse of Crushed Granite Fine as Replacement to River Sand.In India the use of quarry dust to replace river sand was reported by [2].The use of rock dust as an alternative to natural sand was also reported by [5].The use of up to 20% quarry waste fine as a partial replacement for natural sand in the production of concrete,in Malaysia was also reported [6].

Concrete plays the key role and a large quantum of concrete is being utilized in every construction practices.Natural river sand is one of the key ingredients of concrete,is becoming expensive due to excessive cost of transportation from sources.Partial Replacement of Sea and Desert Sand in Place of.Manufactured sand and quarry dust are examples for this type of sand.6) Manufactured Sand As the decreasing quantity of river sand,now the use of manufactured sand as a replacement is increased.M sand is having the properties similar to river sand and it it is obtained by the manual crushing of parent rock for required size.
