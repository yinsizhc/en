## IRON AND STEEL RECYCLING USGS
Approximately three quarters of the iron ore used by domestic integrated steel mills to make iron and steel originated in the United States in 1998.Brazil,Canada,and Venezuela accou nted for more than 90% of iron ore imports,which average about 15 million metric tons per year.Domestic consumption of iron ore was about 78 Mt in 1998.SiC‐based porous ceramic carriers for heat‐conductive,Oct 02,2020&#0183;&#32;The International Journal of Applied Ceramic Technology publishes cutting edge applied research and development work focused on commercialization of engineered ceramics,products and process Abstract Iron tailings remain the environment damaging waste from the iron ore,and high porosity porous ceramics are an attractive material to “turn.
