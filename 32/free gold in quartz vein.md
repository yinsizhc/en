## Genesis and mineralization of gold bearing quartz veins in.
Abstract.Gold bearing quartz veins of the Taihua Group consisting of Archean metavolcanic rocks are a main gold deposit type in the Xiao Qinling area,one of the three biggest gold production areas in China.Lower Gold Standard Lone Jack Mine (Helm Bay) AlaskaIt consists of quartz,calcite,and chlorite,and,in addition to free gold,contains pyrite and minor tetrahedrite and galena.The walls of the vein are well defined by slickensides with gouge on the footwall side,and by a seam filled with calcite carrying free gold along the hanging wall.

## How to find gold in quartz rock specimens
When gold is still encased in quartz rock,it is called a gold specimen.These are a real treat for gold prospectors and collectors as well,and are often valued at a premium due to their beauty and rarity.Hard rock mining,also known as lode mining,is obviously the best method for finding gold specimens since you are mining the true source.Quartz reef mining WikipediaA "reef" is another term for a vein of some mineral or ore,and has nothing to do with biological reefs,such as coral reefs.Quartz is one of the most common minerals in the earth's crust,and most quartz veins do not carry gold,but those that have gold are avidly hunted by prospectors.
