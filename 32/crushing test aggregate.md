Aggregate used in road construction,should be strong enough to resist crushing under traffic wheel loads.If the aggregates are weak the stability of the pavement structure is likely to be adversely affected.The strength of coarse aggregates is assessed by aggregate crushing test.A VERTICAL SOIL CRUSHING ENERGY METERUnfortunately,the currently used soil aggregate crushing energy meter (SACEM) requires aggregates to have a uniquely defined break force in order to measure dry stability.Users have found many conditions of interest where this break force is absent.Thus,the objective of this study was to design a vertical soil crushing energy meter (VSCEM) that did not require an initial break force,used.
