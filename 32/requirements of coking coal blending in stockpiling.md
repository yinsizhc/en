## Blending of coals to meet power station requirements
to meet power station requirements The ultimate aim of coal ­‐fired power plants is to provide the maximum amount of power output at the lowest possible cost.Plant operators must balance the maintenance of plant operation and output with the most inexpensive coals available.Due to changing coal production and markets,many plants will not.Carbon Creek Metallurgical Coal Project Canadian Environmental.The proposed Carbon Creek Project involves the development of a metallurgical coal mine with an anticipated average annual production rate of 4.3 million metric tonnes of clean coal once full production is achieved in 2020.The mine has a life of 20 years with a total of 78.4 Mt of clean coal produced.The Project is located&nbsp;.
