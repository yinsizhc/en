## How I built a quick and easy home made ball mill
The ball mill is powered by a fairly robust 12V DC motor salvaged from a junked printer.It had a pulley for a fine toothed belt on it.It was left in place and it seems to drive the heavy round rubber belt well without slipping.The motor was mounted using screws on.New and Used Ball Mills for Sale Ball Mill Supplier.New and Used Ball Mills for Sale Savona Equipment is a new and used Ball Mill supplier worldwide.A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind materials into extremely fine powder for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.
