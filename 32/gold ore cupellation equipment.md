## Stamp mill Wikipedia
A stamp mill consists of a set of heavy steel (iron shod wood in some cases) stamps,loosely held vertically in a frame,in which the stamps can slide up and down.They are lifted by cams on a horizontal rotating shaft.As the cam moves from under the stamp,the stamp falls onto the ore below,crushing the rock,and the lifting process is repeated at the next pass of the cam.Cupellation Furnace Mineral Processing &amp MetallurgyThe proper temperature for cupellation of gold ores is the same as for silver ores.The lowest temperature at which good soft lead uncovers is about 675&#176—that is,a dull red heat—and a good temperature for the air in the muffle is 700&#176,which need not be reduced throughout the operation.
