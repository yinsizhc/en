Independent RMC operations and cement blenders have used this product successfully since 1998 with reports of the ground granulated arc furnace slag (GGAS) being highly reactive and allowing for substantial saving due to reduction in total binder content.Treatment and characterisation of electric arc. SlagIts effectiveness as hydraulic material is examined before and after heat treatment in an induction furnace.The study shows that while there is a marginal reduction in the early age strength of the Portland Slag Cement mortar,the later age strength does not suffer by replacing up to 20% of Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBFS) by EAF slag.
