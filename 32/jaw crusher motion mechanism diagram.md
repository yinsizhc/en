## Crusher Wikipedia
A jaw or toggle crusher consists of a set of vertical jaws,one jaw is kept stationary and is called a fixed jaw while the other jaw called a swing jaw,moves back and forth relative to it,by a cam or pitman mechanism,acting like a class II lever or a nutcracker.The volume or cavity between the two jaws is called the crushing chamber.Jaw Crusher ScienceDirectThe mechanism of movement of rocks down the crusher chamber determines the capacity of jaw crushers.The movement can be visualised as a succession of wedges (jaw angles) that reduce the size of particles progressively by compression until the smaller particles pass through the crusher in a continuous procession.
