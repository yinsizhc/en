## Selecting Suitable Methods for Treating Mining Effluents
Grinding and flotation of complex sulphide ores in an alkaline media produces a series of sulphur oxyanions called thiosalts.Thiosalts include thiosulphates,polythionates,sulphide,and sulphate.They represent a delayed acid generating capacity in mill effluents that results in a drop in pH and,subsequently,an increase in metal and solidsMethod for magnesium sulfate recovery(Patent) DOE PatentsA method is described for obtaining magnesium sulfate substantially free from radioactive uranium from a slag containing the same and having a radioactivity level of at least about 7,000 pCi gm.The slag is ground to a particle size of about 200 microns or less.The ground slag is then contacted.
