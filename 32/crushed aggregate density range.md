Specific Gravity is the ratio of the weight of a given volume of aggregate to the weight of an equal volume of water.Water,at a temperature of 73.4&#176;F (23&#176;C) has a specific gravity of 1.Specific Gravity is important for several reasons.Some deleterious particles are lighter than the good aggregates.What is the density of a coarse aggregate? QuoraAnswer (1 of 2): it depends on what the aggregate is made of if it is limestone the density is a range of 110 to 135 lb ft square The concrete in Chicago is mostly limestone aggregate but not guaranteed because they may want stronger aggregate brought in from other areas Here in central Wiscon.
