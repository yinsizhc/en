An internal curing composition for concrete includes a glycol and a wax.The glycol is preferably polyethylene glycol and the wax is preferably paraffin wax.When added to concrete,the composition facilitates the curing of concrete to a low porosity,high compressive strength product.Cement hydration Understanding CementHydration products.The products of the reaction between cement and water are termed "hydration products." In concrete (or mortar or other cementitious materials) there are typically four main types: Calcium silicate hydrate: this is the main reaction product and is the main source of concrete strength.It is often abbreviated,using cement chemists' notation,to "C S H," the dashes indicating.
