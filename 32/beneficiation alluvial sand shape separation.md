## Alluvial gold processing plant gold wash plant supplier.
What Is Alluvial Gold? Alluvial is a term that refers to soil sediments and the various sand,silt,gravel,clay or other deposited matter left behind by flowing water."Alluvial gold" refers to the type of gold dust found in that kind of soil.When the beds of rivers or streams are scooped and panned for gold dust,the product is referred to as alluvial gold.
