## Concrete Mix Ratios Cement,Sand,Aggregate and Water
Concrete mix ratio is a vital topic in concrete mix design.The four basic ingredients for making concrete are: Portland cement,sand,aggregate (stone) and water.The strength of concrete mixture depends on the ratio in which these four ingredients are mixed.Asphalt Concrete Questions Flashcards QuizletThe concrete paste usually consists of water cement ratios between 0.8 and 1.0 by weight.False Admixtures are added to the concrete mixture to improve workability,to impart color,to retard the initial set of concrete,to gain rapid hardening and high initial strength,to improve flowability,and to waterproof the concrete.
