## Why is iron extracted from haematite,instead of iron
hey thanks for asking this question,The reason is pyrite is exothermic can cause hazard in mines.It is more economical to extract iron from others minerals.pyrite is geologically unstable and will turn into sulfurous minerals and viable oreREMOVAL OF SULFUR AND PHOSPHOROUS FROM IRON ORE,iron ore,which greatly affects the price of iron ore concentrate Moreover,high contents of sulfur in steel decrease its quality In addition,the presence of sulfur in iron ore concentrates causes environmental issues,especially sulfur dioxide emissions during the pelletizing or smelting process

## Hydrogen Plasma Processing of Iron Ore SpringerLink
Abstract.Iron is currently produced by carbothermic reduction of oxide ores.This is a multiple stage process that requires large scale equipment and high capital investment,and produces large amounts of CO 2.An alternative to carbothermic reduction is reduction using a hydrogen plasma,which comprises vibrationally excited molecular,atomic,and ionic states of hydrogen,all of which can.Iron Ore ScienceDirect7 Iron ore extraction techniques R.Stace Pages 249 Abstract Iron ore reserves are normally found within a few meters from the ground surface,and most of the major mines of the world are operating an opencut system,which requires little sophistication.
