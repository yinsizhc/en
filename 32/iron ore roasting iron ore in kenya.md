## Reduction Roast and Magnetic Separation of Oxidized Iron
AbstractLow grade oolitic iron ore from the Aswan locality,assaying 45.23% Fe and 23.93% insoluble residue,was tested for concentration using reduction roasting and subsequent low intensity magnetic separation for the production of blast furnace feed.The ore is a low grade,high phosphorus,and high alumina oolitic hematite.Fine grinding of the ore was found to be imperative due to theRecovery and separation of iron from iron ore using.hematite with magnetite in the roasted iron ore powder by examining polished thin sections.A vibrating sample magnetometer (Model 7410,Lake Shore,USA) was used to analyze the magnetic properties of raw iron ore powder and roasted iron ore powder at room temperature (about 25 °C).Once the sample had been positioned correctly,the magnetic

Dec 16,2009 · Hello! I live in a region that is rich in bog iron.During the 18 19 century a lot of this ore was mined here for the various high furnaces in operation.From what I could gather in various books as soon as the 17 century it was considered an exellent ore with a low phosphorus and high iron conte.Iron working processesBog ores could easily be worked by digging,but for other ores deeper open cast pits,bell pits and deep mining were used.There is no chronology of iron ore mining,as there are few dated examples to establish the chronology.All iron ores benefit from processing,which may include washing,roasting and crushing.Roasting was most important.
