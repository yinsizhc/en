## Critical speed Wikipedia
In solid mechanics,in the field of rotordynamics,the critical speed is the theoretical angular velocity that excites the natural frequency of a rotating object,such as a shaft,propeller,leadscrew,or gear.As the speed of rotation approaches the object's natural frequency,the object begins to resonate,which dramatically increases system vibration.Critical Rotation Speed for Ball Milling ResearchGateCritical rotation speed of dry ball mill was studied by experiments and by numerical simulation using Discrete Element Method (DEM).The results carried out by both methods showed good agreement.
