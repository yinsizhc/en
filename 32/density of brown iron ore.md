## Density of Iron,ore crushed in 285 units and reference.
Iron,ore crushed weighs 2.5 gram per cubic centimeter or 2 500 kilogram per cubic meter,i.e.density of iron,ore crushed is equal to 2 500 kg m³.In Imperial or US customary measurement system,the density is equal to 156.07 pound per cubic foot [lb ft³],or 1.4 ounce per cubic inch [oz inch³].Uses of iron and aluminium Iron and aluminium GCSE.Aluminium has some advantages over steel.Since it has a lower density than iron or steel,a car body made from aluminium will be lighter than the same car body made from steel.This results in.
