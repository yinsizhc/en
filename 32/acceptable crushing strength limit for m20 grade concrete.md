## CHAPTER 8 DISCUSSION OF TEST RESULTS
split tensile strength is 23%,14.5% and 8.8% for M20,M40 and M60 grades respectively.Similarly when the increase in 28 days flexural strength is observed it is found to be 17.3 %,13.2% and 4.45% more for M20,M40 and M60 grades respectively when compared with concrete.What is the allowable compressive strength of concrete?It is measured by breaking cylindrical concrete specimens in a compresson testing machines.Compressive strength is calculated from the failure load divided by the coss sectional area resisting the load and reported in units of pound force per square inch (psi) of in megapascals (MPa).
