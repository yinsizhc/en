Deep sea mining tailings disposal is a new environmental challenge related to water pollution,mineral crust waste handling,and ocean biology.The objective of this paper is to propose a new tailings disposal procedure for the deep sea mining industry.Through comparisons of the tailings disposal methods which exist in on land mining and the coastal mining fields,a new tailings disposal.Tailings dam WikipediaA tailings dam is typically an earth fill embankment dam used to store byproducts of mining operations after separating the ore from the gangue.Tailings can be liquid,solid,or a slurry of fine particles,and are usually highly toxic and potentially radioactive.Solid tailings are often used as part of the structure itself.Tailings dams rank among the largest engineered structures on earth.
