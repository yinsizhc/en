## Sieve analysis Wikipedia
A sieve analysis (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used to assess the particle size.A typical sieve analysis involves a nested column of sieves with wire mesh cloth (screen).In order to perform the test,a sufficient sample of the aggregate must be obtained.On the graph the sieve size scale is logarithmic.AggregateRegular testing is carried out in accordance with standard test methods for compliance of all aggregate products from each plant with relevant national and internal speciﬁcations.Grading results are captured daily to a central computerised system for continuous analysis to ensure consistence in product quality.
