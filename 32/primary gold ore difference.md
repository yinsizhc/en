COMPARISON OF GEOLOGICAL,GEOPHYSICAL,AND GEOCHEMICAL PROSPECTING METHODS AT THE MALACHITE MINE,JEFFERSON COUNTY,COLORADO By LYMAN C.HUFF ABSTRACT At the Malachite mine a noteworthy discovery of copper ore was made in 1940 as the result of a geophysical survey.Geological and geochemical investigationsCopper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper Ores.Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.
