## The Effect of Aggregate Properties on Concrete
The compressive aggregate strength is an important factor in the selection of aggregate.When determining the strength of normal concrete,most concrete aggregates are several times stronger than the other components in concrete and therefore not a factor in the strength of normal strength concrete.Compressive Strength of Concrete Definition,The compressive strength of concrete is about 4000 psi Definition Strength of hardened concrete measured by the compression test The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it
