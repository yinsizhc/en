## Grinding,Comminution &#187; Test Equipment &#187; Pilot Plant.
Grinding,Comminution At CEMTEC's pilot plant,there are many single machines for conducting tests from batch grinding to continuous grinding tests on a semi industrial scale.As batch grinds always provide only a partial result or a parameter and do not map the entire continuous process,we perform continuous grinding tests.Milling2020 3 2&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The Coalition for Energy Efficient Comminution (CEEC) has been established and is supported by a broad range of mining sector companies keen to accelerate awareness,knowledge transfer and,by implication,improve energy and cost outcomes in the substantive area of comminution.
