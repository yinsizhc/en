Within gold ores,the element occurs in nature chiefly as native gold,which is by far the most common gold bearing mineral.In various gold ores,the native gold commonly occurs as tiny particles contained within sulfide minerals such as pyrite.Iron pyrite is an exceedingly common associate with gold,but it also serves as a reducing agent.Pyrite: The mineral pyrite information and picturesPyrite is sometimes called Fools Gold because of its similarity in color and shape to Gold.In the old mining days,Pyrite was sometimes mistaken for Gold,as they frequently occur together,although Gold and Pyrite can very easily be distinguished by simple observation and testing of characteristics.
