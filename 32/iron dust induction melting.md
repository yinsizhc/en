## Inductive melting in steelworks ABP Induction Systems
volume of dust produced is 0.5 to 1 kg t of melt,the slag ratio is 10 to 15 kg t.Further benefit is that the burnout of the feed materials and alloying agents is minimal.Inductive bath agitation The interplay between the eddy currents induced in the melt and the magnetic induction creates electromagnetic forces,Influence of the cast iron melting processes on.Cast iron can be melted in the cupola furnace,induction furnace (generally of coreless type,but very occasionally can be the channel type for holding) or in the rotary furnace.The electric arc furnace is only very rarely used for the preparation of cast iron.The cupola is the leading device for re melting iron.
