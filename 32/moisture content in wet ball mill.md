Introduction Wet ball mill is a kind of high efficiency ball mill with rolling bearing.This equipment is the main tool for grinding all kinds of crushed minerals again.It can be used to treat the ores with high moisture and argillaceous content.Coal Drying Improves Performance and Reduces EmissionsAfter complete evaporation of fuel surface moisture in the mill is achieved,it becomes possible to control the mill exit temperature by varying the proportion of the hot and cold primary air flows.The predicted reduction in CO 2 and SO 2 mass emissions is presented in Figure 5 as a function of the coal moisture content.
