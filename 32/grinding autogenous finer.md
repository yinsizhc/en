The outside walls of the bowl consist of gratings or perforated plates through which fine product can pass.Grinding is largely autogenous (i.e.it takes place by collision between lumps of raw material),and is very efficient,producing little waste heat,provided that the materials are soft.Optimise your pebble crushing with HPGR · Ranging in size from 25 90mm,pebbles are oversized material produced from autogenous and semi autogenous grinding,which are too coarse to be crushed by larger lumps of ore and steel balls and too fine to act as grinding media themselves.As such,pebbles (or critical particle size material) reduce the efficiency of any mill they’re returned.
