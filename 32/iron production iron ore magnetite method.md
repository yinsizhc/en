## How iron is made
Iron ore is converted into various types of iron through several processes.The most common process is the use of a blast furnace to produce pig iron which is about 94% iron and 5% carbon with smaller amounts of other elements.How iron is madeThe raw materials used to produce pig iron in a blast furnace are iron ore,coke,sinter,and limestone.Iron ores are mainly iron oxides and include magnetite,hematite,limonite,and many other rocks.The iron content of these ores ranges from 70% down to 20% or less.
