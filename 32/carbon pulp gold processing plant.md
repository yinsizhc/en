## Carbon in pulp Wikipedia
Carbon in pulp (CIP) is an extraction technique for recovery of gold which has been liberated into a cyanide solution as part of the gold cyanidation process.Introduced in the early 1980s,Carbon in Pulp is regarded as a simple and cheap process.Carbon Adsorption In Recovery Of Gold Mine Engineer.ComThe carbon in pulp method is only used where tank leaching is utilized for the recovery of gold from the ores and this is not the case in most large gold mines today,since heap leaching is the lowest cost method for recovering gold from ores containing from a few grams to 5 or 6 grams per ton.

## Gold CIP process (carbon in pulp) is one of the gold,
May 20,2020&#0183;&#32;Gold CIP process eliminates the slurry washing and solid liquid separation operations,directly uses granular activated carbon to absorb gold from pulp,and optimizes the traditional cyanidation gold extraction process,which simplifies the industrial production process,improves the leaching efficiency and reduces the production costCarbon in Pulp Gold Ore Processing (Second Edition.Abstract.The introduction of activated carbon to recover gold from cyanide leach solutions in the last quarter of the 20th century had a breakthrough impact on the economics of gold ore processing,as the world gold industry entered a period of unparalleled expansion following the deregulation of the gold price in the mid 1970s.
