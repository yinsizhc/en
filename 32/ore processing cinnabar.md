## Can someone help me understand how the advanced TE4 ore.
Basically,to get the most out of an ore,you need to run it through the induction smelter with an additive,rich slag or cinnebar usually.However,the only way to get rich slag and cinnebar is from prcessing other ore in a particular way and hoping for a secondary product to be made (eg,pulverising redstone ore.Stoneware Glaze Combos Mayco ColorsCinnabar over Copper Ore creates black speckles with Cinnabar showing through.Process: 3 coats of SW 133 Copper Ore were brushed on the bottom ⅔ of the plate.Allowing for the Copper Ore to dry,3 coats of SW 119 Cinnabar were brushed over the top ⅔ of the plate.Cone 6 Oxidation,white stoneware body,fired horizontally.
