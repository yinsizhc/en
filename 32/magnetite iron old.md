## Banded iron formation Wikipedia
Banded iron formations (also known as banded ironstone formations or BIFs) are distinctive units of sedimentary rock that are almost always of Precambrian age.A typical banded iron formation consists of repeated,thin layers (a few millimeters to a few centimeters in thickness) of silver to black iron oxides,either magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) or hematite (Fe 2 O 3),alternating with bands of iron.Meteorite Museum University of New MexicoMagnetite and hematite are common iron bearing minerals that are often mistaken for meteorites.Both minerals can occur as large masses with smooth surfaces that are heavier than typical rocks,but have some features which resemble meteorites.Magnetite is very magnetic (hence its name) and hematite is mildly magnetic.

Is it magnetic? QuoraThe most common type of cast iron is grey cast iron although other types do exist with somewhat different properties.Cast iron contains a lot of carbon compared to steel,around 3 5% this is more than can be absorbed into the structure of the iro.

## Magnetite: The mineral Magnetite information and pictures
Magnetite is an important ore of iron.Well formed crystals are popular among mineral collectors,and the magnetic Lodestone variety is frequently sold in hobby shops to amateur collectors.Magnetite is also of significant interest to the science community due to its strong magnetic properties.Iron Geoscience AustraliaIn the Earth's crust iron is found mainly as minerals of iron oxide such as hematite,magnetite,goethite and limonite.The minerals that are mostly used as ore for making iron are hematite (Fe 2 O 3) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4).Iron is quite soft and easily worked,but it has a very high melting point of 1538°C.
