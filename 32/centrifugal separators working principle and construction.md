## Centrifuge Wikipedia
A centrifuge is a piece of equipment that puts an object in rotation around a fixed axis (spins it in a circle),applying a force perpendicular to the axis of spin (outward) that can be very strong.The centrifuge works using the sedimentation principle,where the centrifugal acceleration causes denser substances and particles to move outward in the radial direction.Centrifugal Separators for Liquid Base ApplicationsOur centrifugal separator are ideal for removing high load suspended solids from liquid slurries.The Russell Liquid Solid Separator™ is an advanced version of traditional separators for liquid based applications.This multi purpose centrifugal separator has the ability to deal with soft and fibrous oversized solids and is adaptable to.

## Centrifugal Chiller Fundamentals Daikin Applied
The compressor assembly is made up of a prime mover and a centrifugal compressor.Daikin chillers use liquid refrigerant cooled hermetic electric motors.The centrifugal compressor is a dynamic device similar to a centrifugal water pump.It raises the pressure and temperature of the refrigerant by converting kinetic energy into pressure.Alfa Laval AlfaPureIf buffer plates are added to a settling tank,the sinking of any particles stops sooner and there is a greater surface area on to which they will fall,helping speed up the separation process.In a centrifugal separator,the same basic principle can be applied,and a corresponding increase in effectiveness achieved,by a stack of special discs.
