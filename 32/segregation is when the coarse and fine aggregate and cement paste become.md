## What is the difference between bleeding and segregation in
In concrete technology,segregation is of three types:1.Separation of Coarse aggregate from the concrete mixture,2.Separation of Cement paste from the concrete during its plastic stage.3.Separation of water from the concrete mix (Bleeding in concrete) Concrete is a mixture of Cement,fine and coarse aggregates.CHAPTER 2 Pumpable Concrete CanusaSegregation—Segregation is separation of coarse aggregate from mortar or separation of cement paste from aggregate in freshly mixed concrete.Mixes that.pipeline wall by a lubricating layer of water,cement and ﬁne sand.which is better.of line being used,on the efﬁciency of the valve on the concrete pump,and on.

## Segregation and Bleeding of Concrete Causes and Prevention
The primary cause of Segregation in concrete is the differences in specific gravity of the concrete material (fine,coarse aggregate and cement).The specific gravity of aggregate is in between 2.62.7g cc and for cement its lies between 3.13.6 g cc,due to these differences,the aggregate separates from the matrix and causes segregation inAggregates in Self Consolidating ConcreteIn total,12 fine aggregates,7 coarse aggregates,and 6 microfines were tested.Tests were conducted on paste,mortar,and concrete.Paste measurements were conducted to evaluate the effects of cement,fly ash,microfines,high range water reducing admixture (HRWRA),and viscosity modifying admixture (VMA) on rheological properties.

## Aggregates in Self Consolidating Concrete
Concrete measurements were conducted to evaluate the effects of fine aggregates,coarse aggregates,microfines,and mixture proportions on workability and hardened properties.Target properties for SCC workability were defined as a function of the application and in terms of filling ability,passing ability,segregation resistance,and rheology.Importance of Aggregate Gradation of concrete slabIf this value is exceeded,the fine aggregate should be rejected unless suitable adjustments are made in proportions of fine and coarse aggregate.The amounts of fine aggregate passing the 300 µm (No.50) and 150,µm (No.100) sieves affect workability,surface texture,air content,and bleeding of concrete.
