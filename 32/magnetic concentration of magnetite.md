## Magnetic Permeability an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The saturation in IRM acquisition curves is mainly influenced by the concentration of magnetite type and hematite type minerals.Magnetite and maghemite are magnetite type minerals and have low coercivity,which means that they are magnetically soft and reach saturation in fields up to 300 mT,resulting in a flat curve at higher fields.indian iron mining project magnetic separation o magnetiteThe concentration of lowgrade magnetic iron ores,separating the magnetite crystalsThe mining chance ofthe dry magnetic separation,when the iron content Inquire Now flotation iron ore beneficiation magnetite
