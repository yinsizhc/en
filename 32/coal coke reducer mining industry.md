After nationalisation of the coal industry in India,India never witnessed demand supply gap until 1991.After liberalisation reforms in 1993,to focus on the increasing energy demand,the government decided to allocate coal mines to various players for captive consumption (in captive mining coal is taken out by a company for its own use and it won't be able to sell it in the market).Coke (fuel) WikipediaCoke is a grey,hard,and porous fuel with a high carbon content and few impurities,made by heating coal or oil in the absence of air — a destructive distillation process.It is an important industrial product,used mainly in iron ore smelting,but also as a fuel in stoves and forges when air pollution is a concern.The unqualified term "coke" usually refers to the product derived from low.
