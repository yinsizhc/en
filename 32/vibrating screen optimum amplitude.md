## Fatigue failure analysis of vibrating screen spring by.
Vibrating screens are often used in the mining industry to separate mineral particles by size.In many designs,spring arrays are used to provide the system with the necessary stiffness for screens to vibrate in a controlled manner.Naturally,these springs are subjected to varying loading cycles,which can cause their premature fatigue failure.STUDY OF INFLUENCE OF VIBRATION PARAMETERS ON THE.vibratory parameters such as amplitude,frequency and throwing index are suggested to find out the optimum vibratory parameters for a specific screening process.The results are also used to formulate mathematical functions between the vibration parameters and the screening efficiency of the vibrating screens for different particles size.2.
