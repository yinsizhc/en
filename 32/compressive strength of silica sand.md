## A REVIEW ON SILICA FUME AN ADDITIVE IN CONCRETE
The target value of compressive strength can be achieved at 10% replacement of silica fume.The strength of 15% replacement of cement by silica fume was greater than the normal concrete.Therefore the optimum silica fume replacement percentage varies from 10% to 15%.Compressive strength decreases when the cement replacement was above 15%.Compressive strength of rocks PetroWikiMechanical failure in rocks generally means either fracturing or permanent deformation as a result of compression.While many methods for calculating failure relationships exist,an initial measure of the compressive strength of reservoir rocks is still needed for use in those calculations.
