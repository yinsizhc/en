## Stone Dust in Concrete: Effect on Compressive Strength
natural river sand in concrete.Use of stone dust in concrete not only improve the quality of concrete but also conserve the natural river sand for future generations.In the present investigation,an experimental program was carried out to study the workability and compressive strength of concrete made using stone dust as partial replacement of fine aggregate in the range of 10% 100%.M25.Experimental Investigation on the Effect of Replacement of.Index Terms—Concrete,quarry dust,sand,admixture,compressive strength.I.analysis shows that there is 40% savings if quarry dust is used instead of sand.Illangoan.R [2000] [1] has done a study on 100% replacement of sand by quarry dust in concrete.The compressive strength of concrete with quarry dust has 40% more strength than that.

## Crushed rock sand An economical and ecological.
The Natural River sand from Banas was mixed with crushed stone sand from Gunavata and Chandwaji and concrete design mixes corresponding to M25 and M30 grade of concrete were prepared.The samples were tested for slump,compressive strength and flexural strength.The effects on each of these properties were examined by changing the percentage replacement of Natural River sand (NS) with …Effect on Compressive Strength of Concrete Made with.Experiments were conducted for control concrete,with replacement of sand only,with replacement of gravel only and with different combinations of replacement of sand and broken stone with crusher dust and gravel.From the experiments conducted,it was inferred that the strength could be improved suitably by replacing sand and broken stone.
