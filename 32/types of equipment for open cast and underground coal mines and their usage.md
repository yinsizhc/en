## Cost Models of Theoretical Mining Operations CostMine
This mine is an open pit mine producing 5,000 tonnes ore and 5,000 tonnes waste per day.Rock characteristics for both ore and waste are typical of those of granite or porphyritic material.Operating conditions,wage scales,and unit prices are typical for western U.S.mining operations.All costs listed are in 2012 US.The Actual Difference Between Surface and Underground MiningFeb 23,2018 · Underground mining is used for gold,platinum,zinc,lead,and increasingly,coal.As can be seen,surface mining is much more advantageous than its counterpart.However,when an outcropping ore body stretches deep inside the Earth,surface methods can be used to begin the mining operation,which then need to be continued further by underground.

## Surface mining Wikipedia
Surface mining,including strip mining,open pit mining and mountaintop removal mining,is a broad category of mining in which soil and rock overlying the mineral deposit (the overburden) are removed,in contrast to underground mining,in which the overlying rock is left in place,and the mineral is removed through shafts or tunnels.Design of a new type of mine rescue relay cabin.The existing underground shelter facilities require long construction time,high usage,operation,and maintenance costs,and they are mainly used for the protection of underground workers.To resolve these issues,this study investigates the design of a new type of mine emergency rescue relay cabin.
