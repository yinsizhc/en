Plagioclase is a series of tectosilicate (framework silicate) minerals within the feldspar group.Rather than referring to a particular mineral with a specific chemical composition,plagioclase is a continuous solid solution series,more properly known as the plagioclase feldspar series (from the Ancient Greek for "oblique fracture",in reference to its two cleavage angles).What is Feldspar? Industrial Minerals Association.Feldspar does not have a strict melting point,since it melts gradually over a range of temperatures.This greatly facilitates the melting of quartz and clays and,through appropriate mixing,allows modulations of this important step of ceramic making.Feldspars are used as fluxing agents to form a glassy phase at low temperatures and as a.
