## Wet milling
Wet milling Wet milling with IKA's inline machines is a safe and efficient alternative to dry grinding.Dry grinding creates a lot of dust which causes the need for proper filtering systems.This can be of particular importance during grinding of substances whose dust,when mixed with aerial oxygen,can result in explosive mixtures.Wet VS.Dry Grinding and PolishingThe choice between wet and dry grinding and polishing is often personal preference.Sometimes people will choose to do a bit of both by starting with wet and switching to dry,but it still won’t turn out quite the same because the slurry created by wet grinding is composed of abrasive particles,which will affect your process.
