## Grinding Circuit
The high unit capacity SAG mill ball mill circuit is dominant today and has contributed toward substantial savings in capital and operating costs,which has in turn made many low grade,high tonnage operations such as copper and gold ores feasible.Future circuits may see increasing use of high pressure grinding rolls (Rosas et al.2012).Ball mill CHUKOH SEIKI CO.LTD.Only crush material and crushing medium (ball) are put into the mill.The characteristic is less contamination of impurities from the liner and grinding medium than wet.The ball mill has an extremely large effective area for pulverization and it is used as a fine pulverizer,and it is used widely,including ceramics and chemical plants.

A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill.beneficiation coal grindingBall mill has simple structure,low cost,high capacity and convenient maintenance.More.Coal Beneficiation an overview ScienceDirect Topics.Coal preparation,or beneficiation,is a series of operations that remove mineral matter (i.e.ash) from coal.Preparation relies on different mechanical operations,which will not be discussed in
