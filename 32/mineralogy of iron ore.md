## Iron Ore Statistics and Information USGS
Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).It almost always consists of iron oxides,the primary forms of which are magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ).Iron ore is the source of primary iron for the world's iron and steel industries.IRON ORE IBMIRON ORE SALIENT DATA OF ORE DRESSING INVESTIGATIONS CARRIED OUT DURING 2001 2012 BY ORE DRESSING DIVISION,INDIAN BUREAU OF MINES SR.CONCENTRATE NO.R.I.NO.TITLE OF THE INVESTIGATION ORIGINAL ANALYSIS % MINERALOGY WT% ASSAY% %REC PROCESS ADOPTED The specific surface area of three iron ore samples is as follows Sr.No.Jindal …

In nature,elemental iron is found largely in either magnetite or hematite,both iron ore minerals.Nearly all iron ore — whether used directly as lump ore or converted to briquettes,concentrates,pellets or sinter — is used to make steel.In the United States,steelmaking accounts for almost 99 percent of iron ore consumption.Minor amounts are consumed in the production of cast iron.Iron Minerals Education CoalitionIron is a common element in many minerals.The minerals goethite,hematite (ferric oxide),lepidocrocite,magnetite (iron oxide) and siderite (iron carbonate) are all mined for iron.The largest concentrations are in iron rich sedimentary rocks,and such deposits are mined in Russia,Brazil,China,Australia,India and the USA.
