## Use of recycled plastics in concrete: A critical review.
The density of concrete containing PAs is lower than that of conventional concrete,whereas that containing PFs does not differ from conventional concrete in terms of density.Furthermore,the density of concrete containing PAs is directly related to the substitution level of plastic aggregate,and mixes with higher R PA exhibit lower density.4.Crushed Concrete Aggregates Properties and Uses of.Density The density of crushed concrete aggregate is smaller than natural aggregate density.4.Water Absorption.Water absorption of recycled aggregate is greater than of natural aggregate.It is one of the most significant properties that distinguish recycled aggregate from raw aggregates.Water absorption of recycled aggregate influence.
