## Powder metallurgy Wikipedia
Powder metallurgy (PM) is a term covering a wide range of ways in which materials or components are made from metal powders.PM processes can avoid,or greatly reduce,the need to use metal removal processes,thereby drastically reducing yield losses in manufacture and often resulting in lower costs.Powder metallurgy is also used to make unique materials impossible to get from melting or.Metal powder in a wide range of alloys — Sandvik Materials.Sandvik is a world leading producer of gas atomized metal powders in particle sizes up to 250 μm.Our specialty is the production of fine metal powder,less than 38 μm.Capabilities include supply of metal powder in small lots for prototype development up to high volume batches for large scale production.
