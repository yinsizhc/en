## Concrete 1 cubic yard volume to short tons US converter
One cubic yard of concrete converted to ton US (short) equals to 2.03 sh tn.How many short tons US of concrete are in 1 cubic yard? The answer is: The change of 1 cu yd yd3 ( cubic yard ) unit of concrete measure equals = to 2.03 sh tn ( ton US (short) ) as the equivalent measure for the same concrete type.The cement industry is the most energy intensive of all.Energy intensive manufacturing accounted for a little more than half of total industrial energy use.Although the cement industry used only one quarter of one percent of total U.S.energy,it is the most energy intensive of all manufacturing industries,with a share of national energy use roughly 10 times its share of the nation's gross output.
