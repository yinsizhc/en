## Gold Extraction Mining Gold.info
Extraction of Gold by the Amalgam Process.The amalgam process is the oldest technical method of extracting gold and was used in antiquity.With the amalgam process the gold bearing rock is likewise crushed to fine sand.Afterwards mercury is added to the rock dust.Gold has the property that enables it to join to the surface of the mercury.Gold extraction WikipediaGold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.
