## Optimal distribution and control of storage tank to. CORE
An integrated urban wastewater model has been used to test three optimization scenarios: optimal flow rate control,storage distribution,and a combination of these two.In addition to the cost of storage tank construction,two receiving water quality indicators,dissolved oxygen and ammonium concentration,are used as optimization objectives.The Importance of pH Measurement in Assuring Product QualityA functional definition of pH is the measurement of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution commonly measured on a scale of 0 to 14.pH 7 is considered neutral,with lower pH values being acidic and higher values being alkaline or caustic.pH is the most common of all analytical measurements in industrial processing and since it is a direct measure of acid content [H+],it clearly plays an.

## Optimal control strategy for fed batch enzymatic.
A mathematical optimal control strategy for feeding operation was developed for fed batch enzymatic hydrolysis of dilute acid pretreated lignocellulosic biomass based on a modified epidemic model.Cellulose conversion was maximized and glucose concentration achieved highest possible value over a fixed hydrolysis time.Boundaries of feeding rate and lignin content were set for feasible controls.An Optimal Control Problem for Hypoxemic Hypoxia Tissue.This paper aims at solving an optimal control problem for determining the response of hypoxia to heart rate and alveolar ventilation that are cardiovascular and respiratory control respectively during a physical activity.A two nonlinear coupled ordinary differential equations is presented.The cost function of optimal control problem is discretized using the linear B splines functions defined.

## Optimal PID control of the dissolved oxygen concentration.
Sep 28,2007 · The efficient performance of the water treatment process depends on the optimal control of the concentration of oxygen in the aeration tanks.This paper describes application of two standard PID controllers tuning methods for control of the nonlinear dissolved oxygen concentration process as a part of an adaptive optimal control strategy.Oxide interface superconductivityThis short review covers the emerging research field of interface superconductivity in complex oxide heterostructures.The first part of the paper is devoted to the prediction and observation of an interfacial superconducting state in metallic insulating copper oxide bilayers.

Within sport psychology,research interest in concentration is predominantly focused in two areas.First is the study of skill failure under pressure,or choking; there is strong evidence that skill failure can result from reinvestment of conscious control processes.Second,researchers have investigated the efficacy of external and internal.An Improved PID Algorithm Based on Insulin on Board.Automated closed loop insulin infusion therapy has been studied for many years.In closed loop system,the control algorithm is the key technique of precise insulin infusion.The control algorithm needs to be designed and validated.In this paper,an improved PID algorithm based on insulin on board estimate is proposed and computer simulations are done using a combinational mathematical model.
