## Can zinc be gold plated EFFECTIVELY with a brush plating.
Can zinc be gold plated EFFECTIVELY with a brush plating system? 2005.I've been told YES but preplate w copper first.And I've been told NO NEVER PLATE ONTO ZINC.Which is "right"? If it CAN be plated,is it a fairly easy process like plating onto steel or nickel? Or is it a nightmare like plating onto aluminum?
