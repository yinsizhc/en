## Copper Refinery Souvenirs
When the fire refining of copper was the main process it was usual to cast it to the form of wirebars for subsequent hot rolling and cold drawing to wire.This souvenir was made for invited guests at the commissioning of the new Southwire Continuous copper wire rod plant on the 17th October 1974 at Enfield Rolling Mills,Middlesex.Copper.Copper in the USA: Copper ProducersCopper in the USA: Bright Future Glorious Past Copper Producers.At the beginning of copper's flow through the economy are the mining companies,which process vast quantities of low grade ore,mostly from open pit mines in order to produce copper.
