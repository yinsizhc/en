Difference Between Rod Mill And Ball Mill Fodamon There are various ratios of the length and diameter of the ball mill,such as those below 2,about 3,and above 4In addition,the rotating speed of the barrel of the rod mill is lower than the working speed of the ball mill of the same specification,so that the medium in the rod mill can work in the dump stateOre discharge modeConsider L:D When Choosing A Lathe For Small Parts.Should shops always defer to Swiss type lathes to process small,long and often complex parts? Not necessarily.As a general rule,a Swiss type is most appropriate for machining workpieces with L:D ratios of 4 to 1 or greater.Parts with lower L:D ratios may be machined economically on turn mills.
