Water based drilling fluid has very little toxicity,made from water,bentonite and barite,all clay from mining operations,usually found in Wyoming and in Lunde,Telemark.There are specific chemicals that can be used in water based drilling fluids that alone can be corrosive and toxic,such as hydrochloric acid.Barite Deposits at Hydrocarbon Seeps from Gulf of Mexico.On Gulf of Mexico (COM) continental slope,oxidation of hydrocarbon rich fluids from the sediment often leads to formation of authigenic carbonates.Barite frequently occurs with these carbonates.The biogeochemical processes involved in carbonate precipitation becoming more understood each year.However,little attention has been focused on barite and comparatively the nature and formation.
