## Guidelines for Open Pit Slope Design 3 Design Edumine,
The design of the slopes is one of the major challenges at every stage of planning and operation of an open pit mine It requires specialised knowledge of the geology,which is often complex in the vicinity of orebodies where structure and or alteration may be key factors,and of the material properties,which are frequently highly variableSlope Design and Implementation in Open Pit Mines.This article reminds the principles of slope design in open pit mines,and presents techniques and tools available to address the successive stages of slope design.Their practical implementation is then illustrated by two case studies of open pit mines.* Corresponding author.Tel.: +33 1 6469 4813; fax: +33 1 6469 4711.

## A new generic open pit mine planning.
It is common in mining industry that the deposits contain multiple correlated attributes of interest.A typical example is iron ore mining,where up to six variables need to be considered in resource estimation and mine planning,namely iron (Fe),silica (SiO 2),alumina (Al 2 O 3),phosphor (P),loss on ignition (LOI) and Ochreous Goethite (GOL),and they are cross correlated.Estimating Mining Factors (Dilution and Ore Loss) in Open Pit Mines.Reserve estimate or mine schedule.Large open pit mines are driven by the economies of scale that are achieved at the cost of less selectivity in the discrimination of ore and waste.Planning for these mines is facilitated by the use of block models for mine design.SLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR OPEN PITS 1 RocscienceSLOPE STABILITY ANALYSIS FOR OPEN PITS.In open pit mining.A design reliability of 80% is generally accepted in open pit design.
