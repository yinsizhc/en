## The Effect of Curing Temperature on the Properties of Cement.
23 Nov 2016.Abstract.This paper investigates the effect of curing temperature on the hydration,microstructure,compressive strength,and transport of cement pastes modified with TiO2 nanoparticles.About 6 g of cement paste powder was prepared by grinding and passing through the sieve #60.The powder was&nbsp;.The Effect of Curing Temperature on the Properties of …&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;The cement pastes cured at 60 C showed a slightly higher degree of hydration than the cement pastes cured at room temperature at all ages.This is due to the accelerating effect of temperature on the dissolution of cement clinkers resulting in enhanced].
