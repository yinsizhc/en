## Flooded mines Wikipedia
A flooded mine is one of the direct results of a mine's closure procedure.When a mine stops to operate,its maintenance systems also stop,in which the dewatering systems are included.Without these systems the mine will get flooded by water that naturally sits in rock formations and in the ground.Technology Data Sheet Mine Dewatering Groundwater EngTechnology Data Sheet Mine Dewatering Groundwater is a common problem when mining,and developing a mine below groundwater level presents many challenges.Poorly controlled groundwater will have negative impacts on the safety,efficiency and economics of mining operations.
