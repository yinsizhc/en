## CiteSeerX — PRODUCTION OF RCA
CiteSeerX Document Details (Isaac Councill,Lee Giles,Pradeep Teregowda): The production of recycled concrete aggregate requires a simple,well defined process.Concrete pavement recycling is a relatively simple process that involves breaking,removing and crushing hardened concrete from an acceptable source to produce recycled concrete aggregate (RCA).Strength of Recycled Concrete Made From Crushed Concrete.Compressive strength of hardened concretes made from recycled concrete coarse aggregates was studied as a function Of the compressive strength of original concretes from which the coarse aggregates were derived Also studied were properties of fresh concretes made from recycled aggregates,gradings of crusher products,properties of recycled.
