The crushing strength of a brick is found out by placing it in a compression testing machine It is pressed till it breaks As per BIS: 1077 1957,the minimum crushing or compressive strength of bricks is 350 N mm2 The bricks with crushing strength of 7 to 14 N mm2 are graded as A and those having above 14 N mm2 are graded as AA (3.Is the compressive strength of mortar important? Masonry.For ASTM C90 concrete block,the assembly compressive strength only increases 250 psi when the mortar is changed from Type N to Type S (from an f' m of 1750 psi to 2000 psi for CMU units with 2000 psi compressive strength).The compressive strength of the masonry units is the largest factor,by far,in masonry assembly compressive strength.
