Quicklime both high calcium and dolomitic enjoys its most extensive use as a flux in purifying steel in the electric arc furnace (EAF) and basic oxygen furnace (BOF).Lime is particularly effective in removing phosphorus,sulfur,and silica,and to a lesser extent,manganese.Lime also has important uses in secondary refining of steel and in the manufacture of steel products.The Roles of Coal and Coke in Steelmaking · The steel,flux and iron melts in the oven and impurities are driven off,resulting in liquid steel.Higher quality coke results in higher quality steel.Another well known process of steel making is completed with an electric arc furnace.Unlike a blast furnace,an electric arc furnace uses no iron in steel making.Coke and coal are not.

## Flux (metallurgy) Wikipedia
In metallurgy,a flux (derived from Latin fluxus meaning "flow") is a chemical cleaning agent,flowing agent,or purifying agent.Fluxes may have more than one function at a time.They are used in both extractive metallurgy and metal joining.Some of the earliest known fluxes were carbonate of soda,potash,charcoal,coke,borax,lime,lead sulfide and certain minerals containing phosphorus.
