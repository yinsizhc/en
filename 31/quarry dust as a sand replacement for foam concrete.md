Improved Concrete Properties Using Quarry Dust as Replacement for Natural Sand Anzar Hamid Mir Student,Bachelor of Civil Engineering,IUST Awantipora,J&K,INDIA Abstract: Concrete plays a major role in the construction industry.Natural sand is a prime material used for the preparation of concrete and also plays an important role in Mix Design.Should I Use Stone Dust or Sand Between Patio Pavers?Should I Use Stone Dust or Sand Between Patio Pavers? The freeze and thaw cycle does affect patios,and there’s no shortage of this phenomenon in New Jersey If your personal preference for the look and feel of the dust outweighs the stability of the sand,then choosing the stone dust,
