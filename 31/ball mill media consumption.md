## Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency
The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.As well,mills with different.ball mill grinding media consumption phmb.infoA discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear.One of the major problems regarding the use of ball mills is to balance the size distribution of grinding media into the mill,which is determined by the speed of consumption and rate of replacement [3],as the wear of the grinding balls requires their substitution at intervals.
