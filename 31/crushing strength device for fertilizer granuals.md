## Crushing Strength John Deere Ag
Crushing Strength.Crushing strength is the minimum pressure needed to crush individual particles.Determining the crushing strength,or hardness,will help determine handling and storage requirements of a chosen granular product.1 Measure crushing strength by applying pressure to individual granules.Urea Finishing Process: Prilling Versus Granulation.Solid urea is the largest nitrogen fertilizer product which is produced in two forms of granules and prills.Although the chemical properties of both prills and granules remain similar,their different physical and mechanical properties are distinguishable and make them suitable for different application either as fertilizer or raw materials for chemical industry.

## Knowledge grows From Factory to Field
Crushing strength of fertilizers.The crushing strength of fertilizer particles difers greatly depending on the chemical composition and production process Crushing strength measured for various fertilizer types is illustrated above.Please note that high N NPK's show lower crushing strength than NPK's with high content of salts.Cogranulation of Low Rates of Graphene and Graphene Oxide.The beneficial effects of graphene (GN) and graphene oxide (GO) additives on the physical properties of monoammonium phosphate (MAP) fertilizer granules were investigated.Low doses (0.05 to 0.5% w w) of GN and GO sheets were cogranulated with MAP and effects on the crushing strength,abrasion and impact resistance of prepared granules were evaluated.
