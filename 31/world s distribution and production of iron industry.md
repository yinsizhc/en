Element production in supernovas and distribution on Earth greatly favor iron over nickel,and in any case,56 Fe still has a lower mass per nucleon than 62 Ni due to its higher fraction of lighter protons.Hence,elements heavier than iron require a supernova for their formation,involving rapid neutron capture by starting 56 Fe nuclei.Iron &amp; Steel Manufacturing in the USFind industry analysis,statistics,trends,data and forecasts on Iron &amp; Steel Manufacturing in the US from IBISWorld.Get up to speed on any industry with comprehensive intelligence that is easy to read.Banks,consultants,sales &amp; marketing teams,accountants and students all find value in IBISWorld.
