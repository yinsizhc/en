## Iron Simple English Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia
Iron is a chemical element and a metal.It is the second most common metal on Earth,and the most widely used metal.It makes up much of the Earth's core.The extreme heat makes the carbon react with iron ore,taking off the oxygen from iron oxides,and making carbon dioxide.The carbon dioxide is a gas and it leaves the mix.Gold extraction WikipediaGold extraction refers to the processes required to extract gold from its ores.This may require a combination of comminution,mineral processing,hydrometallurgical,and pyrometallurgical processes to be performed on the ore.Gold mining from alluvium ores was once achieved by techniques associated with placer mining such as simple gold panning and sluicing,resulting in direct recovery of.
