A metallurgical assay is a compositional analysis of an ore,metal,or alloy.Some assay methods are suitable for raw materials; others are more appropriate for finished goods.Raw precious metals are assayed by an assay office.Silver is assayed by titration,gold by cupellation and platinum by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES).Productivity in mining operations: Reversing the downward.Mining companies worldwide largely lost sight of productivity goals that had underpinned operating discipline in the lean years of the 1980s and 1990s,when parts of the industry had set a healthy record in productivity improvement (Exhibit 1).As the demand boom gathered pace,cost increases related to expanding production got badly out of.
