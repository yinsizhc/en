## Sintering Wikipedia
Sintering or frittage is the process of compacting and forming a solid mass of material by heat or pressure without melting it to the point of liquefaction.Sintering happens naturally in mineral deposits or as a manufacturing process used with metals,ceramics,plastics,and other materials.The atoms in the materials diffuse across the boundaries of the particles,fusing the particles.Magcraft Rare Earth 3 4 in.x 1 16 in.
