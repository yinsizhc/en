## Manganese Wikipedia
Manganese is a chemical element with the symbol Mn and atomic number 25.It is found as a free element in nature; it is often found in minerals in combination with iron.Manganese is a transition metal with a multifaceted array of industrial alloy uses,particularly in stainless steels.US4872909A Process for acid leaching of manganese oxide.A method of processing manganese ore by adding the ore to an aqueous solution of acid and H 2 O 2 to form a leach pulp.The leach pulp is agitated for a predetermined time period at predetermined temperatures.The leach pulp is then separated into a solid fraction and a liquid fraction containing solubilized metals.The solubilized metals are then recovered from the liquid fraction.

## process of manganese mining
Manganese possesses chemical properties that make it an ideal input into the making of alloys.It is commonly obtained through manganese ore in the form of manganese oxide (also known as pyrolusite),or through iron ores.Manganese production is thus often subsumed under iron mining.CN1861815A Process of continuously leaching manganese.A method relates to extract the manganese dioxide from ore,its technological processes is as follows: according to the ratio of 1:0.10 0.40:0.2 0.6,mixing the manganese dioxide powder,pyrites,sulfuric acid or manganese sulfate,and then continuously putting them into the continuous bank which are composed of 1 6 agitated banks,so it can form continuously extraction,the temperature of.
