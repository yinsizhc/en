Supporters of monorail and other sleek structures argue that because the structures are thinner than conventional rail viaducts,they're cheaper and more aesthetic.They even argue that viaducts,which are more expensive than at grade construction,are actually better.Transrapid does that,and Hyperloop does that as well.Hyperloop proponents specifically mention the the structure's lighter.DEPARTMENT OF THE ARMY ER 1110 2 1302construction efforts needed for project completion must be included in the cost estimate.These costs might address such items as performance specifications,deliveries,site.respective work breakdown structure and features and cost sharing agreements.ER 1110 2 1302.
