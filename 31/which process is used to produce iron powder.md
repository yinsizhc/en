Why Powder Metallurgy is Important •PM parts can be mass produced to net shape or near net shape,eliminating or reducing the need for subsequent machining •PM process wastes very little material about 97% of the starting powders are converted to product •PM parts can be made with a specified level of porosity,to produce porous metal partsS1001 Steel Powder Iron Powder Manufacturers and.S1001 is a highly compressible,water atomized steel powder specifically designed for high density,high strength powder metallurgy and powder forging applications.In addition to the powder metallurgy,S1001 is used in production of brazing pastes,metal clays,magnetic paints,and resin casting.Specific properties of S1001 include:

2.PRODUCTION OF IRON AND STEEL POWDERS 8 2.3 The Höganäs Sponge Iron Process The Höganäs sponge iron process,is essentially a chemical process in which ﬁnely divided iron ore is being reduced with coke breeze yielding a spongy mass of solid metallic iron,which can readily be comminuted to iron powder.The iron ore used atIron powder WikipediaThe iron properties differ depending on the production method and history of a specific iron powder.There are three types of iron powder classifications: reduced iron powder,atomized powder,and electrolyte iron powder.Each type is used in various applications depending on their properties.

## Reduced iron powder DOWA Electronics Materials Co.Ltd.
Reduced iron powder.Reduced iron powder is produced using sponge type iron that is obtained by reducing high quality iron oxide through a heating process as the base.Various functions of 'iron' are used in a variety of fields.HOW TO MAKE EDTA CHELATED IRON FERTILIZERS ARTICLES.Plants use various iron uptake mechanisms.One of these is the chelation mechanism the plant releases compounds called siderophores which bind iron and enhance its solubility.This mechanism also involves bacteria.Another mechanism involves the release of protons (H+) and reductants by the plant roots,to lower pH levels in root zone.
