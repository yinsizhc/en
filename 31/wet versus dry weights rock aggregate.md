In other words,you could take your bucket of dry sand and fill it with water and move not one single grain of sand out of the bucket.So equal volumes of wet and dry sand would not weigh the same; the wet sand would weigh more because it has more mass,the mass of the water in between the sand and the mass of the sand itself.Standard Test Method for Bulk Density (“Unit Weight”) and,11 This test method covers the determination of bulk density (“unit weight”) of aggregate in a compacted or loose condition,and calculated voids between particles in fine,coarse,or mixed aggregates based on the same determination This test method is applicable to aggregates not exceeding 125 mm [5 in] in nominal maximum size
