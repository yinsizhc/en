## How Underground Mining Works HowStuffWorks
Underground mines are the alternative to surface mines.Surface mines excavate from the top down,a method that can become inefficient at depths greater than about 200 feet (60 meters) [sources: Illinois Coal Association,De Beers].Undergrounds coal mines can drive 2,500 feet (750 meters) into the Earth and other types even deeper uranium mines can reach 6,500 feet,or 2 kilometers.Chapter 1: Mine Ventilation An OverviewPerhaps the greatest classical paper on mine ventilation was one entitled 'On the theory of the ventilation of mines',presented by John Job Atkinson to the North of England Institute of Mining Engineers in December,1854.Atkinson was a mining agent—an intermediary between manage ment and the mine owners.
