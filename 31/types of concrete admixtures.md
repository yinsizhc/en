## Concrete Wikipedia
Concrete is a composite material,comprising a matrix of aggregate (typically a rocky material) and a binder (typically Portland cement or asphalt),which holds the matrix together.Many types of concrete are available,determined by the formulations of binders and the types of aggregate used to suit the application for the material.These.Use of Water Reducers,Retarders,and SuperplasticizerThe use of retarding admixture has the main drawback of the possibility of rapid stiffening,where rapid slump loss will result in difficulty of concrete placement,consolidation,and finishing.
