## Calorific value COALspot
The energy value of coal The energy value of coal,or the fuel content,is the amount of potential energy in coal that can be converted into actual heating ability.The value can be calculated and compared with different grades of coal or even other materials.Materials of different grades will produce differing amounts of heat for a given mass.Lower and Higher Heating Values of Fuels Hydrogen ToolsThe higher heating value (also known gross calorific value or gross energy) of a fuel is defined as the amount of heat released by a specified quantity (initially at 25&#176;C) once it is combusted and the products have returned to a temperature of 25&#176;C,which takes into account the latent heat of vaporization of water in the combustion products
