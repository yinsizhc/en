## Explosives and Blasting Agents Chemical Economics.
The principal distinction between explosives and blasting agents is their sensitivity to initiation.Explosives are cap sensitive,whereas blasting agents are not and therefore require a primer.Water gels and slurries may be either explosives or blasting agents.Explosives Used in Mining: Properties,Types,Transport.Explosives differ widely in resistance to water and moisture penetration.Some explosives deteriorate rapidly under wet conditions,but others are designed to stand water long enough to enable the work to be done.When blasting is to be performed under wet conditions a gelatinous or slurry explosive.
