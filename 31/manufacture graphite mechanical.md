## Mechanical properties of graphite material
The mechanical properties are directional and vary with the grain and across the grain.Isostatic pressing gives the most uniform product with the highest density and improved strength,but its an expensive route.The extruded graphite aligns the grain in the direction of extrusion,yielding a product with anisotropic properties,but is relatively cheap and is used for the manufacture of parts.NAICS Code 335991 Carbon and Graphite Product ManufacturingFor some business types,there may be a similar industry to NAICS Code 335991 Carbon and Graphite Product Manufacturing that is a better classification match.Establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing carbon or graphite gaskets are classified in U.S.NAICS Code 339991 Gasket,Packing,and Sealing Device Manufacturing.
