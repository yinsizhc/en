## The Value of Soybean Oil in the Soybean Crush: Further,
On September 8,2017,the price of soybeans at Iowa soybean processing plants was $936 per bushel,the price of soybean meal was $28890 per ton,and the price of soybean oil was $034 per pound The typical assumption is that a 60 pound bushel of soybeans yields 48 pounds of high protein soybean meal (465 percent),11 pounds of soybean oil.History of Soybean Crushing: Soy Oil and Soybean Meal Part 1In about 1907 the first soybean crushing began in the West,initially in England,which quickly became the dominant crushing country in Europe.Shortly thereafter soybean crushing also began on the Continent,especially in Germany,and after 1911,in the US.Most of the oil was used in soaps and the meal in mixed livestock feeds.

By Tom PolansekCHICAGO,Dec 20 (Reuters) The U.S. China trade war is spooking potential investors in soybean crushing plants planned for Wisconsin and New York state,developers said,casting doubt on the future of a sector that had been a rare bright spot in the U.S.farm economy.Crushers in the United States have been posting near record profits by snapping up cheap and plentiful soybeans.Potential economic impact and basis analysis of a soybeanSoybean basis: A fully operational soybean crushing plant in Crookston will raise the basis by an estimated 10 to 20 cents per bushel.Plant construction: In total,construction of the plant will generate $134.0 million of economic activity in Polk County.This includes $43.1 million in labor income.
