## Concrete cube strengths what use are statistics?
A review of statistical rules for concrete testing and characteristic strengthCompressive strength WikipediaThe compressive strength of the material would correspond to the stress at the red point shown on the curve.In a compression test,there is a linear region where the material follows Hooke's law.Hence,for this region,=,where,this time,E refers to the Young's Modulus for compression.In this region,the material deforms elastically and returns to its original length when the stress is removed.
