## Partial Replacement of Sand with Quarry Dust in Concrete
The reduction in the sources of natural sand and the requirement for reduction in the cost of concrete production has resulted in the increased need to identify substitute material to sand as fine aggregates in the production of concretes especially in Concrete.Quarry dust,a by product from the crushing process during quarrying activities is one of such materials.Compressive Strength by Incorporating Quarry Dust in SelfK.Shyam Prakash and C.Rao,&quotStudy on compressive strength of quarry dust as fine aggregate in concrete,&quot Advances in Civil Engineering,vol.2016,2016.B.Rai,S.Kumar,and K.Satish,&quotEffect of fly ash on mortar mixes with quarry dust as fine aggregate,&quot Advances
