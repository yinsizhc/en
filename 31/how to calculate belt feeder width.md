## Belt Conveyors for Bulk Materials Calculations by CEMA 5.
Belt Widths The belt widths are as follows: 18,24,30,36,42,48,54,60,72,84,and 96 inches.The width of the narrower belts may be governed by the size of lumps to be handled.Belts must be wide enough so that any combination of prevailing lumps and finer material does not load the lumps too close to the edge of the conveyor belt.Width of Conveyor Belt bulk onlineJan 10,2007 · (If you are talking troughed belt conveyors.) Then there is an added edge clearance of 50mm per side for spillage limitation.It is more convenient,for manual calculation,to select a belt width & calculate its carrying cross section.Most design handbooks contain tabular values of cross section area for standard belt widths & troughing angles.
