## Detection of Malfunctions and Abnormal Working Conditions.
The coal is fed to the coal mill through the central inlet pipe,where it is pulverized by a series of large balls separated by two types of rings.The pulverized material is carried out in the mill by the flow of air moving through it.The primary air is a mixture of cold air and air heated by the preheaters.Journal of Physics: Conference Series PAPER OPEN ACCESS.mill in which the coal is grind into smaller particles and injected into boiler through airflow.In this study there are seven mill included to study effect of coal flow and air flow rate on the flow of each pipe.Each mill has four pipes entering the boiler at four different corners.This is important to enable
