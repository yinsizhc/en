## A Technical Review on Quarry Dust and Foundry Sand Used.
the study is to replace the sand partially or fully by Quarry stone dust or Foundry sand in mortar as in future there will be depletion of sand.Hence,it is necessary to find inexpensive and easily available alternative material to Natural River Sand.Key words: Quarry Stone dust,Foundry sand,Compressive strength,Tensile strengthUSE OF QUARRY DUST IN CONCRETE AS REPLACEMENT2018103&ensp&#0183&enspthe characteristic and design compressive strength values for various grade of concrete.We prepare both concrete and mortar mix using quarry dust and results are very surprisingly.Compressive strength of quarry dust concrete and mortar is comparatively high with normal concrete.
