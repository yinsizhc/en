## Rapid Sand Filters Water Treatment Process & Plant Design
The Rapid Sand Filter (RSF) water treatment equipment differs from the Slow Sand Filter water treatment equipment in a variety of ways,the most important of which are the much greater filtration rate and the ability to clean automatically using back washing.The mechanism of particle removal also differs.Rapid sand Water filter does not use biological filtration and depends primarily on.Multimedia (sand) Filtration Calculation LenntechThese filters are called multi media filters because they contain different layers of filtration media ordered in decreasing porosity.Multi media water filters are able to trap and retain a far larger number of particles (generally down to 10 25 microns) than traditional sand filters.
