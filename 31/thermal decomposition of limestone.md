## How Does Limestone Affect the Environment? Reference.com
Limestone mining can pollute water and create sinkholes.When limestone dissolves while it's still in the ground,caves and gullies form,a natural phenomenon known as karst.Although this doesn't hurt the environment in its natural form,once the limestone is mined out,sinkholes can form and disrupt underground waterways.Calcination WikipediaIn limestone calcination,a decomposition process,the chemical reaction is CaCO 3 → CaO + CO 2 (g) The standard Gibbs free energy of reaction is approximated as ΔG&#176; r = 177,100 − 158 T (J mol) The standard free energy of reaction is 0 in this case when the temperature,T,is equal to 1121 K,or 848 &#176;C Oxidation In some cases,calcination of a metal results in oxidation of the metal

1.IntroductionThe main chemical property of limestone is its thermal decomposition,known as “calcination”,during which quicklime (CaO) and carbon dioxide are produced.Difference Between Quicklime and Hydrated Lime Compare.Aug 16,2018 · The key difference between quicklime and hydrated lime is that the quicklime (or burnt lime) contains calcium oxide whereas the hydrated lime (slaked lime) contains calcium hydroxide.The major source for both quicklime and hydrated lime is the limestone.Therefore,like limestone,these compounds are also alkaline.We call quicklime as "burnt lime" because we produce it by the thermal.
