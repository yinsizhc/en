## The benefits of dry machining The Engineer The Engineer
The benefits of dry machining.Machine speeds are making dry machining more practicable.A generation ago a typical 150200mm diameter face mill could be left running for more than an hour on a 10mm depth of cut,churning through at 200300rpm."The choice between dry and wet machining depends therefore mainly on the type of machiningProduce with CEREC Dentsply SironaThe new CEREC grinding and milling machines come equipped with a device to And there is no difference in quality between dry and wet milling processes.
