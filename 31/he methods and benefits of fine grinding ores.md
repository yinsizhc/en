Run of the mine ore is physically reduced by crushing and grinding methods (figure 2).The optimum degree of grinding is determined by the extraction methods used to remove the economic product.A simple mineralogical examination can hold the key to identifying the most advantageous extraction methods to use.The examination can also determine other minerals of economic interest,the type …Zinc Rock Files Australian Mines AtlasGravity and magnetic separation methods were unsuccessful but in 1901 a flotation process was devised at Broken Hill which achieved recoveries of the zinc minerals from ore upwards of 60%.After considerable experimentation,a selective flotation method which worked on a commercial scale was perfected in 1912.Improved versions of this flotation process,such as the Australian developed.
