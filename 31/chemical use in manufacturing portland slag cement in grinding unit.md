## Portland cement Wikipedia
Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and nonspecialty grout.It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century,and usually originates from limestone.It is a fine powder,produced by heating limestone and clay minerals in a kiln to form clinker,grinding theJSW Cement will use UAE plant to growThe company grew out of the JSW Group's development of steel production and the opportunity for slag grinding.The steel division has 18Mta of steel production capacity.The Vijaynagar units in Bellary district,Karnataka,have a combined capacity of 3.4Mta and use a Loesche VRM to produce Portland slag cement and ground granulated blastfurnace.
