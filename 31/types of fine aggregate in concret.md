## Aggregates
Aggregates are inert granular materials such as sand,gravel,or crushed stone that,along with water and portland cement,are an essential ingredient in concrete.Classification of Aggregates Based on Size and Shape.Aggregates can be classified in many ways.Classification of aggregates based on shape and size such as coarse and fine aggregates are discussed here,Aggregates are the important constituents of the concrete which give body to the concrete and also reduce shrinkage.Aggregates.
