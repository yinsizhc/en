## What is the use of coal in the cement manufacturing.
Primarily for cement grinding plants in India,coal (generally of bituminous grade) is used in the slag dryer.The wet slag arrives at the stack on wagons from some nearby steel plant,or it may be brought via a trolley system (primitive mode).Bu.what goes on to coal moisture inside a verticle coal millCoal mill pulverizer in thermal power plants SlideShare.Primary air flow inside the mill is affected by both reduction in temperature due to moisture evaporation and drag forces by coal particles of various sizes.In addition,moisture evaporation increases the primary air flow rate and conversely reduces the coal flow rate.
