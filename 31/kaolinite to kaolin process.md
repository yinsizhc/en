## Kaolin Imerys
The process which converted the hard granite into the soft matrix found in kaolin pits is known as ‘kaolinization’.The quartz and mica of the granite remain relatively unchanged whilst the feldspar is transformed into kaolinite.Smectite may also form in small quantities in some deposits.Kaolin of the first clays used to make Kaolin ProcessKaolinite Chemically kaolin is identified by the formulae Al2Si2O5 (OH) 4,or as Al2O3·2SiO2·2H2O.Therefore Kaolin is an alumina silicate as indicated by the formulae.S tructurally kaolin is a platy mineral.Repeat units of Si tetrahedron form the Si sheet; whereas repeat units of Al octahedron form the Al sheet.Kaolin Process Kaolin is usually removed from the mines in large moist lumps.
