## Boral Acquires PMI Ash Beneficiation Technology Concrete.
Mar 26,2018 · Boral announces that it acquired the Carbon Burn Out ("CBO") technology developed and deployed by PMI Ash Technologies,LLC.CBO technology is used to improve the quality of fly ash produced at coal fueled electric generating stations,making the ash suitable for use in concrete and other high value applications.Beneficial Reuse of Coal Ash from Dominion Energy Coal Ash.Coal fly ash has a long and successful history of re use in the US and many other countries in the world.Coal fly ash was recognized as a pozzolanic material (material with cementitious properties when mixed with calcium hydroxide) as early as 1914 and started to be used in concrete in the 1930s (Aggarwal et al.2010; ARTBA,2011).
