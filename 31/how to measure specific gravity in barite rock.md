## How do I Calculate Density? Calculating Density
How do I calculate specific gravity? To calculate the specific gravity (SG) of an object,you compare the object's density to the density of water: Because the density of water in g cm 3 is 1.0,the SG of an object is will be almost the same as its density in g cm 3.However,specific gravity is a unitless number,and is the same in the metric.DENSITY and SPECIFIC GRAVITYDensity and Specific Gravity defined Density is expressed in terms of mass per unit volume.The density of water,often used for comparisons,can be expressed as 1.0 g cm3 or 1,000 kg m3.Mineralogists often use the unit less measurements of specific gravity,which is the density of a mineral relative to that of an equivalent volume of water.A.
