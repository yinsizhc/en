## How are igneous rocks classified? Wenatchee Valley College
For example,a coarse grained,felsic igneous rock is not only a granite,it is an intrusive igneous rock that formed from slow cooling and crystallization of a body of magma within the earth's crust.The intrusion of large bodies of granite batholiths is usually part of the origin of a mountain range.Graniterock: ProductsHowever,some granite has no contact with surrounding wall rock,so it must have gradually degraded into metamorphic rock.Others show relic features found in sediments.This evidence suggests that some granite is not igneous in origin,but metamorphic.Some granite is the oldest known rock on earth.

Igneous rock is one of the three main rock types.and granite.Igneous rock formed from lava that has become solid on the outside of the Earth is called extrusive.Igneous Rocks: Formation,Types and Examples Earth EclipseWhat are Igneous Rocks? Igneous rocks form from the cooling of magma molten materials in the earth's crust.The terminology Igneous means fire or heat.In this sense,igneous rocks are formed when molten rock (magma) solidifies either underneath the earth crust to form plutonic (intrusive) igneous rocks or on the surface of the earth to form.
