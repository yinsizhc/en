## Manufacturing Light Concrete with PET Aggregate
The manufacture of concrete using a polymer instead of a stony coarse aggregate known as gravel is presented.Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the polymer used,recycling soft drink containers with sufficient tenacity.PET is a material commonly used by engineers as a structural element,not as an aggregate.The research work revealed that PET aggregate produces good quality mixtures with.Difference Between Fine Aggregate and Coarse Aggregate.Difference Between Fine Aggregate and Coarse Aggregate.May 29.Many materials are used to form aggregate such as sand,gravel,stone,crushed rock,and sometimes even waste slug from iron and steel industry.It is important to mix both fine and coarse aggregate in concrete as coarse aggregate cannot cover the surface area in the manner.

## What is the role of aggregates in concrete? Quora
Aggregate's impact on different characteristics and properties of concrete is certainly huge.The significant reality is that some of 70 80% of the amount of concrete volume is taken by the aggregates itself.It is therefore significantly importan.Appliions of Aggregates in Concrete,Railway BallastAggregates are the most mined material in the world.Construction aggregate is a broad egory of granular raw material of different sizes (sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete etc) used in construction.Aggregate can be used in a number of ways in construction.In roads and railway ballast the aggregates are used to resist the overall (static as well as
