## Pulverized coal burners Powerz
Pulverized coal burners are stocked with ignition devices and sensors which selectively control the burner's torch.Currently,two types of vane swirlers are used for twisting secondary air: axial and tangential.Depending on parameters determining the quality of coal such as ash,abrasiveness and reactivity,either axial vane or scrollBurner Component Upgrades for Wall Fired Coal Burnersat the entrance to the coal nozzle,redistributes the coal particles entering the pulverized coal burner to break up the coal "rope" that develops in any typical coal piping system.Coal ropes can contribute to high CO emissions and high flyash UBC by presenting too dense a coal stream to the combustion field.
