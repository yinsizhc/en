totally different from those used for steel.In fact,if you heat up some alloys and quench them,they will become softer instead of harder.Be aware of the differences and act accordingly.3.When welding steels,you can almost always make a weld that is as strong as the parent material.Hardness WikipediaHardness is a measure of the resistance to localized plastic deformation induced by either mechanical indentation or abrasion.Some materials (e.g.metals) are harder than others (e.g.plastics,wood).Macroscopic hardness is generally characterized by strong intermolecular bonds,but the behavior of solid materials under force is complex; therefore,there are different measurements of hardness.
