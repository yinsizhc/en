## A proposal for bauxite quality control using the combined.
 · In the bauxite industry exploration,beneficiation and refinery two main chemical parameters are used for the quality control: available alumina (AvAl 2 O 3) and reactive silica (RxSiO 2).Both are determined using a procedure that simulates the Bayer process at the laboratory scale.Mining and Refining Bauxite Residue ManagementProcess; Water Management; Bauxite Residue.It is primarily composed of the insoluble fraction of the bauxite ore.which aims to convert bauxite residue.
