## mining engineering: INTRODUCTION TO MINING
The mining engineer may also be involved with the closure and reclamation of the mine property,although he or she may share those duties with those in the environmental fields.The fields of processing,refining,and fabricating are assigned to metallurgy,although there is often some overlap in the mineral processing area with mining engineering.Bachelor of Science in Mining EngineeringThe BS Mining Engineering degree program is fully accredited and offers a variety of rigorous and interesting cours The goal of the program is to train students qualified to perform the various functions typically exercised by mining engineers: plan,design,operate,and close min
