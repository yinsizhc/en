## Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Today we will learn about difference between sag mill vs ball mill.A mill is a machine by which solid or hard materials are broken into smaller pieces by means of grinding,crushing or cutting.This commutation is an essential part of many processes.Various kinds of mills are there with which different material processing takes place.Static Eliminators ProductsEXAIR's Gen4 Ion Air Gun combines incredibly fast static decay rates with low compressed air consumption.It is the ideal way to remove static,contaminants and dust from three dimensional parts prior to assembly,packaging,painting or finishing.The Gen4 Ion Air Gun neutralizes static electricity and cleans at distances up to 15 feet (4.6m).

## How to Eliminate Electrostatic Charging of Powder.
Powder processing operations can generate vast quantities of electrostatic charge via the movement of powder.The standard method of charging on powder processing operations is due to tribo electrification,which is basically the contact and separation of the powder with processing equipment,the powder itself,or other factors that can cause charging,like surface contaminants.Antistatic composite coаtings on the basis of powder …For protection of magnesium alloy shells the technique is offered which combines formation of the oxidized sublayer,introduction of electroconductive filler,treatment of the powder mixture in the planetary ball mill and electrostatic deposition of sifted mixture of
