## Effect of amendments on the leaching behavior of alkaline.
Bauxite residue,generated by alumina industries,is a highly alkaline waste possessing a high salt content and hence having negative effects on the surrounding environment (Ujaczki et al.2016).So far,there has been a dependence on storing bauxite residue waste in stack.In 2018,global storage of the residues reached 4.6 billion tons.list of magnetite depositsJul 04,2020&#0183;&#32;Welcome to YPJY Heavy Industry Machinery Since its establishment in 1989,YPJY Heavy Industry Machinery has always focused on the R&D and manufacturing of large scale equipment required for national infrastructure construction projects such as mining,construction,and energyAnd provide professional EPC one stop solutions and mature,

## Bauxite ALS
Approximately 85% of the world’s bauxite production is metallurgical bauxite and the alumina is extracted from the bauxite in a refinery using a wet chemical caustic soda leach process known as the Bayer process The alumina is then converted to aluminium metal via electrolysis in a smelter using the energy intensive Hall Heroult processBeneficiation of High Silica Bauxite Ores. SpringerLinkAbstract.Many bauxite reserves in India have Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 ratio of 4 to 6 and hence pose difficulties in production of alumina through the Bayer process.The extraction of alumina from bauxite in low temperature digestion circuit frequently involves a desilication step in which kaolinite dissolves and reprecipitates as sodalite,a caustic insoluble sodium alumino silicate.
