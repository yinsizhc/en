## The Aggregate Expenditures Model and Fiscal Policy
Suppose that the slope of the aggregate expenditures function (that is,b[1 − t]) is 0.6,so that the multiplier is 2.5.An increase of 200 billion in government purchases shifts the aggregate expenditures curve upward by that amount to AE 2.In the aggregate expenditures model,real GDP increases by an amount equal to the multiplier times.Consumption and the Aggregate Expenditures ModelThe aggregate expenditures curves for price levels of 1.0 and 1.5 are the same as in Figure 28.13 &quotFrom Aggregate Expenditures to Aggregate Demand" as is the aggregate demand curve.Now suppose a $1,000billion increase in net exports shifts each of the aggregate expenditures curves up AE P=1.0,for example,rises to AE ′ P=1.0.
