## DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION Digital Scholarship
DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF A WATER TUNNEL By Stephen C.Ko This work has been carried out as a part of a grant from the National Science Foundation.HVAC Ducting Principles and FundamentalsSeveral issues must be considered in an effective design.A primary issue is the tradeoff between the initial cost of the duct system and the energy cost of the air distribution system; larger ducts require a larger initial investment,but result in lower fan energy costs over the life of the system.

This elbow doesn't use transitions,so it doesn't have the problem of wearing them out.However,they can have the problem of wearing out the sides before the top,compromising the structural integrity of the elbow.Furthermore,when the top of the elbow wears away there may be some open pocket areas between the round elbow and the square back.(DOC) The design of the Stone of Tizoc Terry Summerson,The design of the Stone of Tizoc Introduction The Stone of Tizoc is one of the most important and impressive of the carved Aztec artefacts Made from basalt it is approximately 2660 mm in diameter and 880mm high and features on its upper surface an image of the sun and around the sides are relief carvings showing fifteen pairs of warrior figures positioned between,
