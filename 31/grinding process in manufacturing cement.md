## Grinding (abrasive cutting) Wikipedia
Creep feed grinding (CFG) was invented in Germany in the late 1950s by Edmund and Gerhard Lang.Unlike normal grinding,which is used primarily to finish surfaces,CFG is used for high rates of material removal,competing with milling and turning as a manufacturing process choice.3.3 Raw Materials for Cement ManufactureThe wet process,which was once standard,has now been rendered obsolete by the development of efficient dry grinding equipment,and all modern cement plants use the dry process.When it is ready to enter the kiln,the dry raw mix has 85% of the particles less than 90 £gm in size..

## What is the purpose of adding gypsum in cement?
During the cement manufacturing process,upon the cooling of clinker,a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process.Gypsum is added to control the "setting of cement".If not added,the cement will set immediately after mixing of water leaving no time for concrete placing.How Cement Is MadeCement is so fine that 1 pound of cement contains 150 billion grains.The cement is now ready for transport to ready mix concrete companies to be used in a variety of construction projects.Although the dry process is the most modern and popular way to manufacture cement,some kilns in the United States use a wet process.
