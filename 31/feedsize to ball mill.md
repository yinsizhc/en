## Ball Mill Load &amp; feed
&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;Re: Ball Mill Load &amp; feed.Dear GKS,You are correct in stating that main drive kw only increase when less grinding media charge and small size of grinding media w.r.t.feed size and feed rate.However,it was to be stated in my reply that Kwh t of material increases in chocked condition of the mill as there is no output from the mill.Warm regardsCalculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum GrindingIn Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize “just in case”.
