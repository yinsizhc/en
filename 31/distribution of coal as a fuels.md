Coal can be converted directly into synthetic fuels equivalent to gasoline or diesel by hydrogenation or carbonization.Coal liquefaction emits more carbon dioxide than liquid fuel production from crude oil.Mixing in biomass and using CCS would emit slightly less than the oil process but at a high cost.Distribution of Fossil Fuels National Geographic SocietyJun 26,2019 · Deposits of fossil fuels depend on the climate and organisms that lived in that region millions of years ago,and the geological processes that have since taken place.For instance,while coal reserves are found in every country,the largest reserves are found in the United States,Russia,China,Australia,and India.
