## 101 What is Particle Size Distribution D50,D50 Particle.
Particle Size Distribution D50 is also known as median diameter or medium value of particle size distribution,it is the value of the particle diameter at 50% in the cumulative distribution.Optimum choice of the make up ball sizes for maximum.Further,the ball size distribution in the mill is not a simple parameter that can be controlled directly,as it depends on the make up ball charge and wear rate.Therefore,the industrial practice of determining the make up ball sizes comes down to experience.
