## The working principle of ball mill
The ball mill consists of a metal cylinder and a ball.The working principle is that when the cylinder is rotated,the grinding body (ball) and the object to be polished (material) installed in the cylinder are rotated by the cylinder under the action of friction and centrifugal.Ball Mill RETSCH powerful grinding and homogenizationLaboratory ball mills for powerful size reduction and homogenization.and homogenize small sample volumes quickly and efficiently by impact and friction.
