## Iron Ore Prices and News Iron Ore
Iron ore pellets can be made by two different processes,the Straight Grate process and the Grate Kiln process.The Grate kiln system consists of three machines; a traveling grate,a rotary kiln and an annular cooler which heats,hardens and cools the ore respectively.SolidPhase Reduction of Iron from Suroyam TitanomagnetiteIn this work the solidphase reduction of iron from the Suroyam titanomagnetite ore was studied during metallization in a rotary kiln.The technique of preparation of the ore and reducing agent for metallization and the process of continuous processing of materials in a rotary kiln were described in detail.For metallization the temperature was chosen 1150&#176C,due to low melting point of
