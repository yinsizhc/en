## System dynamic analysis of construction waste recycling.
 · With the acceleration of China’s urbanization process,construction activities have led to a substantial increase in construction waste.However,as China’s construction waste recycling rate is low,it is difficult to convert construction waste into valuable products for the sustainable development of waste resources.The biggest reason for this is the construction waste industrial chain.Australian researchers use plastic dialysis scrap to.Dynamic disc screens make it easy to adjust the screen size for different types of materials.In terms of versatility,capacity and footprint,a dynamic disc screen is a much more efficient solution.Vibratory and rotating drums that have the same capacity will require two to three times the footprint.
