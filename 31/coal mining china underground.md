## Advances in coal mining technology ScienceDirect
Coal mining is generally classified as either surface or opencast mining,and underground or deep mining.Generally the type of coal mining selected is determined by the geological characteristics of the proposed mine,the location of the coal seam or seams,and the equipment available at the time the mine is to begin operation.Coal Mine Methane Country Profiles,Chapter 7,June 20152,059 mines are owned by large,state owned coal mine groups (known as “key coal mine groups”),accounting for 61.7 percent of total coal production.An additional 10,067 mines are operated by villages and towns (Guoquan,2010).See Table 7 3 below.Most coal mines in China are underground mines.As of 2012&nbsp;.
