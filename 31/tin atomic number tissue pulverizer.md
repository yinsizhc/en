## Tin an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Tin is a metal that is insoluble in water,and it is not very electropositive and,therefore,may be obtained by reduction with a wide variety of reducing agents,including certain metals (Al,Zn,etc.).Tin may exist either as the metal or in the +2 or +4 oxidation states.Tin forms a large number.CHARGED PARTICLE IONIZATION AND RANGEionization completely removes the electron from the atom.Ionization creates an ion pair,which is the (now) free electron and the positively charged atom from which the electron was removed.The freed electron may possess sufficient kinetic energy to cause further ionization events (such energetic electrons are sometimes called delta rays).
