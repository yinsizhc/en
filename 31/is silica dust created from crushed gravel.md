Silica dioxide has two forms: crystalline and amorphous.It turns out that crystalline silica dioxide is hazardous to breathe and is well documented to cause silicosis and myriad respiratory disorders.Glass dust,however,is not crystalline silica dioxide but amorphous silica dioxide.As with many situations,the devil is in the details.Gravel WikipediaCrushed stone may be made from granite,limestone,dolomite,and other rocks.Also known as "crusher run",DGA (dense grade aggregate) QP (quarry process),and shoulder stone.Fine gravel: gravel consisting of particles with a diameter of 2 to 8 mm.Stone dust: fine,crushed,gravel from the final stage of screen separation.

Silica dust is harmful when inhaled into your lungs.As it is 100 times smaller than a grain of sand,you can be breathing it in without knowing.Exposure to silica dust can lead to the development of lung cancer,silicosis (an irreversible scarring and stiffening of the lungs),kidney disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Crushed Stone vs.Quarry Process vs.Stone DustStone Dust.Stone dust,also known as stone screenings,is the finest of the types of crushed stone.Although it is made from the same type of stone as the other two types,it is crushed into a powder.When used by itself stone dust forms a hard surface that is water resistant.When used with a larger stone it acts as a binding agent.
