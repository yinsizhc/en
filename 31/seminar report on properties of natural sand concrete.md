## Natural fiber reinforced concrete ScienceDirect
Recent findings report that silane coating of fibers is a good way to improve the durability of natural fiber reinforced concrete (Bilba and Arsene,2008).Other authors mentioned that using pulped fibers may improve durability performance (Savastano et al,2001).Concreteas natural stone or steel,which generally have to be.gregate or sand,while all material that is retained on the #4 sieve is referred to as coarse aggregate,gravel,or stone.and other concrete properties solely based on the properties and proportions of the mix components.
