## How aluminum is made material,manufacture,making,used.
Process Aluminum manufacture is accomplished in two phases: the Bayer process of refining the bauxite ore to obtain aluminum oxide,and the Hall Heroult process of smelting the aluminum oxide to release pure aluminum.The Bayer process 1 First,the bauxite ore is mechanically crushed.Alumina chemical compound BritannicaSome alumina is still produced by melting bauxite in an electric furnace,in a process devised for the abrasives industry early in the 20th century,but most is now extracted from bauxite through the Bayer process,which was,
