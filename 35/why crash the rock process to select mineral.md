## What is a Rock? Earth Eclipse
What is a Rock? Rocks ordinarily lie everywhere on the ground of the earth They constitute most of the landforms,as we often noticeFor instance,rocks make up the mountains and most of the non water portions of the earth’s surfaceMinerals,Rocks & Rock Forming ProcessesMinerals in the Earth's Crust.There are more than 3000 known minerals (the number is still growing),but of these only about 20 are very common,and only 9 of these constitute 95% of the crust.These 9 minerals are all silicates,and are also called the rock forming minerals.They can be subdivided into two groups,the mafic and felsic minerals according to the principal rocks types they mainly.

## Chemical Weathering Definition,Processes and Types,
Wikipedia says,“Chemical weathering changes the composition of rocks,often transforming them when water interacts with minerals to create various chemical reactionsChemical weathering is a gradual and ongoing process as the mineralogy of the rock adjusts to the near surface environment ” Chemical weathering happens because the processes are gradual and ongoing,therefore changing the.Metamorphic Rocks,Processes,and ResourcesMetamorphic Rocks,Processes,and Resources Metamorphic rocks are rocks changed from one form to another by intense heat,intense pressure,and or the action of hot fluids.Protolith or parent rock is the rock type that a metamorphic rock was before it was subjected to metamorphic conditions.

## Weathering Processes Physical Geography
Weathering Process Weathering is the process that changes solid rock into sediments With weathering,rock is disintegrated into smaller piec Once these sediments are separated from the rocks,erosion is the process that moves the sediments away from it’s original position,Many silicate minerals form in igneous or metamorphic rocks.The types of rock: igneous,metamorphic and sedimentaryJan 12,2015&#0183;&#32;The types of rock: igneous,metamorphic and sedimentary,That’s why you see rocks such as granite with big crystals,as well as new minerals resulting from the metamorphosis process.

## What is the process by which metamorphic rock is formed?
In the rock cycle,any sedimentary rock can be transformed into a metamorphic rock due to deep burial where the rock is changed by the earth's high temperature and pressure,an exposure to a.Mineral WikipediaMinerals are not equivalent to rocks.A rock is an aggregate of one or more minerals or mineraloids.Some rocks,such as limestone or quartzite,are composed primarily of one mineral calcite or aragonite in the case of limestone,and quartz in the latter case.Other rocks can be defined by relative abundances of key (essential) minerals; a granite is defined by proportions of quartz.
