## Bituminous Coal an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The more intense heating and pressure results in further chemical changes in the organic molecules,as well as (physical) changes in the appearance of the coal.In bituminous coals,specific plant components in the coal (macerals) become more homogenous,and the cell structures of woody material within the coal (still visible in lignite and.Chemical and Physical Composition of BitumenCoal tar is a brown or dark black liquid of high viscosity,which smells of naphthalene and aromatic hydrocarbons.Being flammable,coal tar is sometime used for heating or to fire boilers.It can be used in coal tar soap,and is used in medicated shampoo to kill and repel head lice,and as a treatment for dandruff.Depending upon its source of origin,TAR is classified as:

Coal composition.Coal is a mineral in which the chemical element of carbon is prevalent.Carbon content (the so called coalification) depends foremost on the time during which the conversion from plant matter to the final mineral took place.The older the coal,the higher the carbon percentage and the less apparent the original vegetable component,i.e.the fossil,remains of plant tissues.Bituminous coal IspatGuru · Bituminous coal is the second highest quality of coal (below anthracite) and the most abundant type.Usually,bituminous coal comes from fairly old coal deposits (around 300 million years old).The energy density of this coal is relatively high,therefore,…
