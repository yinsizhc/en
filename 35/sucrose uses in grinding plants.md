The Student RoomSucrose moves from sources (e.g.leaf) to a sinks (e.g.root) via phloem,which is a plant vascular system that transports photosynthates around the plant.Once the sucrose has reached the sink,it can either be hydrolysed directly (into glucose + fructose) for energy or alternatively used to synthesise polymers such as starch and cellulose.
