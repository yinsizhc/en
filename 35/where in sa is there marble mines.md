## Mining Wikipedia
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension stone,rock salt,potash,gravel,and clay.Marble WikipediaMarble is a metamorphic rock composed of recrystallized carbonate minerals,most commonly calcite or dolomite.Marble is typically not foliated,although there are exceptions.In geology,the term marble refers to metamorphosed limestone,but its use in stonemasonry more broadly encompasses unmetamorphosed limestone.Marble is commonly used for sculpture and as a building material.
