## Milling Speed and Feed Calculator CustomPart.Net
Milling operations remove material by feeding a workpiece into a rotating cutting tool with sharp teeth,such as an end mill or face mill.Calculations use the desired tool diameter,number of teeth,cutting speed,and cutting feed,which should be chosen based on the specific cutting conditions,including the workpiece material and tool material.Application notes2016 6 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;The calculation of the maximum al&#173; lowable residual specific unbalance as&#173; sumes that the mass of the rotor is evenly distributed about the centre of gravity.If the mass of the rotor is unevenly distributed,the calculations are a little more complicated.In a perfectly balanced rotor,equal forces act on both ends of the rotor when it rotates.
