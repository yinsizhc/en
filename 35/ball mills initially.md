## High Energy Ball Milling
High energy ball milling is a ball milling process in which a powder mixture placed in a ball mill is subjected to high energy collisions from the balls.High energy ball milling,also called mechanical alloying,can successfully produce fine,uniform dispersions of oxide particles in nickel base super alloys that cannot be made by conventional.007355 USDAing involves a ball mill,the actual operation is more of an unraveling of the fiber to expose the fibrils,which have nanoscale dimensions.During the ball milling step of production the active sur face area of the collagen increases more than 200 times without chemically altering or denaturing the collagen.To demonstrate this throughout the
