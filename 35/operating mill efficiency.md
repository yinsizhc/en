## Engine efficiency
Engine efficiency of thermal engines is the relationship between the total energy contained in the fuel,and the amount of energy used to perform useful work.There are two classifications of thermal engines Internal combustion (gasoline,diesel and gas turbine Brayton cycle engines) and; External combustion engines (steam piston,steam turbine,and the Stirling cycle engine).Vertical Roller MillsFor raw materials and cement clinker,the vertical roller mill is an excellent grinding solution because of the relatively lower cost of installation,ease of operation and maintenance,energy efficiency and product quality.Further,our vertical roller mill solution for cement grinding has an ability to dry,gri
