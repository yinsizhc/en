## MICROWAVE CALCINATION AND SINTERING OF MANGANESE CARBONATE ORE
AbstractManganese carbonate ores are becoming an increasingly important source of manganese.Usually these ores undergo thermal pretreatment which involves calcination and agglomeration using fossil fuels as the major energy source.In this study,the application of microwave energy for the pretreatment step was investigated.The real and imaginary permittivities of a material determine its.Introduction List of Most Common Carbonate MineralsThis is an introduction list that covers the most common carbonates minerals which are compounds of carbon dioxide (frequently called carbonic acid) with oxides of metals.In naming individual carbonates,the name of the metal is used; but if the name of the oxide of the metal is better known,as lime,for example,which is calcium oxide,the name of the oxide will be used instead of the name.
