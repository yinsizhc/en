## Calculate Horsepower For Inclined Screw Conveyors
Screw conveyors can be used to convey bulk materials at an inclined angle,but several areas of design should be examined first.Because of the incline of the screw,several conveying problems begin to occur.1.The horsepower per unit of material increases 2.Screw Conveyor Corporationdetermine your best conveyor design.Since the Screw Conveyor selected is based on a maximum volume control of material to be handled,surge loads,overloads and choke feeding must be accounted for in the conveyor design.Screw feeders are popularly used for this

## Design of Screw Conveyor Size of Screw Conveyor Screw.
Design of Screw Conveyor: The size of screw conveyor depends on two factors.1.The capacity of the conveyor.2.The lump size of the material to be conveyed (Maximum dimensions of the particle) Usually there are three ranges of lump sizes which are considered for selection of screw size.These are:Bucket Elevators Screw Conveyor SThese bucket elevators are generally constructed from either a centrifugal or a continuous design.Centrifugal bucket elevators are ideal for powdered solids including: sand,sugar,grains,and chemicals.This type of bucket elevator utilizes a high speed centrifugal force to toss the materials from the bucket into the targeted area.

The solid material retained on the screen is moved along the cone via an internal screw conveyor while the liquid output is obtained due to centrifugal force causes the feed slurry to pass through the screen openings.Furthermore,screen scroll centrifuge may rotate either in horizontal or vertical position.Range of applicationsScrew Conveyors TPI Engineered SystemsThis information is basic guidance in selecting an appropriate screw conveyor and has been excerpted from the book entitled,Screw Conveyors 101 and is authored by Mike Forcade,a member of our staff.Another possible solution is a "Shaftless Screw",which uses a very heavy flight,but no center pipe.

## Screw conveyor Wikipedia
A screw conveyor or auger conveyor is a mechanism that uses a rotating helical screw blade,called a "flighting",usually within a tube,to move liquid or granular materials.They are used in many bulk handling industries.Screw conveyors in modern industry are often used horizontally or at a slight incline as an efficient way to move semi solid materials,including food waste,wood chips.
