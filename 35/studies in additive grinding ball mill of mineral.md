## Studies in additive grinding of minerals ScienceDirect
The effects of solid and liquid additives on a dry grinding process were studied at four additive concentrations and two grinding times,using a laboratory vibration ball mill with calcite as the feed material,under selected milling conditions.Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding EfficiencyThe following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.As well,mills with different.
