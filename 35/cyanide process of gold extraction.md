## Cyanide Leaching Of Gold
Once the gold has been dissolved in the cyanide,and the ore body has been reasonably depleted of its gold,there are two main processes for recovering the gold from the pregnant cyanide solution.One is the Merrill Crowe zinc precipitation process and the other is the adsorption of the gold.How is cyanide used in gold mining? QuoraCyanide,in the form of a very dilute sodium cyanide solution,is used to dissolve and separate gold from ore.Cyanide leaching is considered to be a much safer alternative to extraction with liquid mercury,which was previously the main method of removing gold from ore.

## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Cyanide's efficiency makes mining more wasteful.Because cyanide leaching is very efficient,it allows profitable mining of much lower ore grades.Mining lower grade ore requires the extraction and processing of much more ore to get the same amount of gold.Partially due to cyanide,modern mines are.much larger than before cyanide was used;the cyanide process of gold extraction process technologyTo extract gold from ore,mining companies typically use the sodium cyanide process,A new process for extracting gold from ore is based on the fact that The company is now optimizing the technology to maximize extraction yields.
