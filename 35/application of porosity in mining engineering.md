New type curves suitable for practical applications based on the model by Warren and Root were introduced by Bourdet et al.17,18 These curves are primarily used for diagnosing dual porosity behavior and for ensuring that an optimum,conclusive test is obtained.The idea behind these curves is that the log log plot consists of three typical flow regimes as follows:Porosity and permeability values fugroand mining sectors,NMR’s application for engineering and land geotechnical projects is quite innovative Fugro has implemented the technology as part of its borehole geophysics offering because it can provide valuable hydrogeological insight for near surface site characterisation projects The NMR technique effectively logs both porosity and permeability and can distinguish between mobile.
