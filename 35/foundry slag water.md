## Explanation of Significant Differences Ruston Foundry.
Foundry operations resulted in metals contaminated waste which was dispersed throughout the property as fill material.As a result of this disposal activity,foundry derived process wastes (slag,foundry sand piles,metal scrap,and castings) covered most of the Site and contaminated the soil.Slag WikipediaThe water carries the slag in its slurry format to a large agitation tank,from where it is pumped along a piping system into a number of gravel based filter beds.The filter beds then retain the slag granules,while the water drains away and is returned to the system.
