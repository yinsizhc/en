So just how do we get electricity from water? Actually,hydroelectric and coal fired power plants produce electricity in a similar way.In both cases a power source is used to turn a propeller like piece called a turbine,which then turns a metal shaft in an electric generator,which is the motor that produces electricity.A coal fired power plant uses steam to turn the turbine blades; whereas.Step by step on how electricity is generated using coal?Electricity is most often generated at a power station by electromagnetically generators.There are several disadvantages to using coal to generate electricity.

Well,a coal fired power plant converts heat to electrical energy in much the same way that it’s done in a gas fired power plant,a nuclear power plant,or even a solar thermoelectric power plant.The only thing that differs among these different types of power plants is the way that the heat is generated.Coal Power Impacts Union of Concerned ScientistsIn the United States,roughly 30 percent of all electricity comes from coal: the rest comes from natural gas.The same is true for coal fired power plants,which produce more than 100 million tons of coal ash every year.More than half of that waste ends up in ponds,lakes,landfills,and other sites where,over time,it can contaminate.
