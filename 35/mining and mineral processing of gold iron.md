## Introduction to Mineral Processing
Gold,silver,copper,lead,zinc,molybdenum,iron,potash,phosphate,and even sand for glass are often processed by froth flotation.Without froth flotation,many of the metals and minerals used every day in our modern world would be much more expensive.Solvent Extraction Solvent extraction is a hydrometallurgical process.The process entails:Mining Open Development Cambodia (ODC)The mining sector in Cambodia is mostly undeveloped,and active mining enterprises are typically small scale quarries producing materials for construction,such as laterite,marble,granite,limestone,gravel and sand.There is no industrial scale extraction of minerals,although many exploration licenses have been granted to mining companies and some have reported promising finds of gold.
