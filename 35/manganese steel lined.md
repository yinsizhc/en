## Mangalloy Wikipedia
Mangalloy,also called manganese steel or Hadfield steel,is an alloy steel containing an average of around 13% manganese.Mangalloy is known for its high impact strength and resistance to abrasion once in its work hardened state.Manganese Substitution Grades of Stainless Steel Rolled.During World War II when nickel shortages were severe,the stainless steel industry turned to manganese as a substitute.Manganese is about half as effective in forming austenite as is nickel,so for every 1% reduction in nickel content,roughly 2% of manganese must be substituted.
