## Pickett Mountain,ME Wolfden Resources Corporation
A average metal content of the +70 holes that have intersected the two lenses indicate approximately 10% Zn,4% Pb,1.5% Cu and 100 g t Ag.Preliminary metallurgical work completed in 1984 on drill core produced 3 floatation concentrates with recoveries of 88% zinc,78% lead and 78% copper.Bioaccessibility of As,Cu,Pb,and Zn in mine waste.&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Given the proximity of residential communities to these mining residues,we investigated samples of mine waste (n = 5),urban soil (n = 6),and road dust (n = 5) with a special focus on the solid speciation of As,Cu,Pb,and Zn using a combination of methods (XRD,SEM EDS,oxalate extractions),as well as on in vitro bioaccessibility in.
