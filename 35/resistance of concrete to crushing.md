## Properties of concrete Wikipedia
Concrete has relatively high compressive strength (it doesn't crack under weight),but significantly lower tensile strength (it cracks when being pulled) The compressive strength is typically controlled with the ratio of water to cement when forming the concrete,and tensile strength is increased by additives,typically steel,to create reinforced concrete
