## Drilling Techniques for Mining Exploration
It is the most common drilling technique used for mining exploration,particularly in South America and Australia.RC drilling is a form of percussion drilling,by which the rock is made to fail through the use of a piston that delivers rapid impacts to the drill stem,transferring energy to the drill bit.Glossary of Mining TermsRoom and pillar mining A method of mining flat lying ore deposits in which the mined out area,or rooms,are separated by pillars of approximately the same size.Rotary drill A machine that drills holes by rotating a rigid,tubular string of drill rods to which is attached a bit.Commonly used for drilling large diameter blastholes in open.
