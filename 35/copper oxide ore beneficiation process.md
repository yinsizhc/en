## Copper extraction Wikipedia
Until the latter half of the 20th century,smelting sulfide ores was almost the sole means of producing copper metal from mined ores (primary copper production).Davenport Consequently,the development of the froth flotation process was a major step forward in mineral processing.It madeIntroduction to Mineral Processing Chevron Phillips ChemicalIn ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.Oxide copper ore,lowgrade copper sulfide overburden,and other coppercontaining materials are stacked into a heap.
