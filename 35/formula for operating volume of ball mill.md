## Rod Mill an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Rod mills are used in an open circuit between crushing and the ball mill.They often operate in wet and where the pulp contains up to 50% solid by mass.This machine is equally very applicable to dry where it could take a feed that has achieved 6% moisture.As such,when the product is sticky,rod mills are preferred over ball mills.Ball MillsBall Mills are generally used to grind material 1 4 inch and finer,down to the particle size of 20 to 75 microns.To achieve a reasonable efficiency with ball mills,they must be operated in a closed system,with oversize material continuously being recirculated back into the mill to be reduced.

## The effect of ball size on mill performance
The specific rates of breakage of particles in a tumbling ball mill are described by the equation S i = ax α i (Q(z),where Q(z) is the probability function which ranges from 1 to 0 as particle size increases.This equation produces a maximum in S,and the particle size of the maximum is related to ball diameter by x m = k 1 d 2.The variation of a with ball diameter was found to be of the form.MODELING THE SPECIFIC GRINDING ENERGY AND BALL201713&ensp&#0183&ensp2 MODELLING THE SPECIFIC GRINDING ENERGY AND BALLMILL SCALEUP Ballmill scale up (Bond's Law)Data: zBond work index w i zFeed D f and product d size (both 80% cumulative passing) Result: The specific grinding energy w Mill power draw P = wT,where T the mill capacity Mill dimensions (from Tables or charts)
