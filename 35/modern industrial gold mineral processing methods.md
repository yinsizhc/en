## Placer Mining Methods
Mineral processing,art of treating crude ores and mineral products in order to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock,or gangue.It is the first process that most ores undergo after mining in order to provide a more concentrated material for the procedures of extractive metallurgy.Artisanal and Small Scale Gold Mining Without Mercury.Although many miners use mercury in artisanal and small scale gold mining,it is possible to safely and economically recover gold without it.Mercury free techniques are safer for miners,their families and local communities.They may also help miners market their gold at higher prices.

## How Gold Is Mined Gold Mining Process World Gold Council
Mar 24,2020 · The lifecycle of a gold mine.People in hard hats working underground is what often comes to mind when thinking about how gold is mined.Yet mining the ore is just one stage in a long and complex gold mining process.Long before any gold can be extracted,significant exploration and development needs to take place,both to determine,as accurately as possible,the size of the deposit.Mineral processing Dewatering BritannicaMineral processing Mineral processing Dewatering: Concentrates and tailings produced by the methods outlined above must be dewatered in order to convert the pulps to a transportable state.In addition,the water can be recycled into the existing water circuits of the processing plant,greatly reducing the demand for expensive fresh water.
