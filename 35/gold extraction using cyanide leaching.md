Cyanide leaching has been the industry standard for gold processing for more than 100 years.During the cyanide leach process,a cyanide solution,or lixiviant,is percolated through ore contained in vats,columns or heaps.Gold is dissolved by the cyanide and then removed from the heap or columns.Dargues Reef,part of the 659 km2 Majors Creek Gold Project situated approximately 60km southwest of Canberra,just north of the village of Majors Creek.
