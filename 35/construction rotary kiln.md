## The cement kiln Understanding Cement
The original rotary cement kilns were called 'wet process' kilns.In their basic form they were relatively simple compared with modern developments.The raw meal was supplied at ambient temperature in the form of a slurry.A wet process kiln may be up to 200m long and 6m in diameter.It has to be long because a lot of water has to be evaporatedMain construction of rotary kiln Rotary kiln,rotary dryer.The basic components of a rotary kiln are the shell,the refractory lining,support tyres and rollers,drive gear and internal heat exchangers.Kiln Shell This is made from rolled mild steel plate,usually between 15 and 30 mm thick,welded to form a cylinder which may be up to 230 m in length and up to 6.

## Design and construction of a rotary kiln simulator for use.
Design and construction of a rotary kiln simulator for use in studying the incineration of hazardous waste: Date: 1989 08: Description: Rotary kilns have been used extensively in the cement industry to calcine limestone.In the past few years,the technology has been viewed as a possible option for the incineration of hazardous waste materials.Rotary Kilns KHD InternationalKiln plants with two and three station rotary kilns from KHD Humboldt Wedag are top of the line.One reason: highly efficient precalcining systems,which were developed by KHD Humboldt Wedag,revolutionizing the clinkering process.Rotary kilns no longer have to function as calciners which mean that they can be substantially smaller in size.
