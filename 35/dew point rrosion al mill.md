## What is a Dew Point? Definition from Corrosionpedia
Jan 18,2017 · At the dew point temperature,water vapor condenses into liquid water.At all times,the dew point temperature is equal to or less than the air temperature.A thorough knowledge about dew point temperature is very important in various industries because moisture can affect corrosion rates.Dew point may also be known as dew point temperature.Compressed air dryingThe dew point is a parameter which is often used to measure the dryness of the air,air at 35&#176;C containing 39g of water vapor per m&#179;,which is 100% relative humidity,has a dew point of 35&#176;C.

Paper Machine Corrosion Is it the material or the environment? Paul E.Glogowski Product Manager Thermal Blades Beloit WI Corrosion is the destruction or deter ioration of a material because of reactions with its environment Many fields are applied to understanding corrosion Fortunately this can be summarized by the following:Low Temperature Corrosion in Biomass Combustiontemperature corrosion,dew point depends on H 2 SO 4 (g) and H 2 O concentrations • Generally,no acid dew point corrosion in biomass combustion • Acid dew point corrosion is more a problem in fossil fuel combustion • In fluidized bed combustion of biomass no H 2 SO 4 due to relatively low furnace temperature leading to low SO 3 formation.
