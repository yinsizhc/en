## Effects of Aggregates and Mineral Fillers on Asphalt.
This publication,Effects of Aggregates and Mineral Fillers on Asphalt Mixture Performance,contains papers presented at the symposium of the same name,held in San Diego,CA on 10 Dec.1991.The symposium was sponsored by ASTM Committee D 4 on Road and Paving Materials.Application of calcined clay as aggregate for asphalt.Application of calcined clay as aggregate for asphalt pavement and surface treatment.This research attempted to study the possibility of using calcined clay as a coarse aggregate in asphalt pavement and the surface treatment on the real road surface.The road test sections were constructed on the secondary road in the central part of Thailand.

## Construction aggregate Wikipedia
Construction aggregate,or simply "aggregate",is a broad category of coarse to medium grained particulate material used in construction,including sand,gravel,crushed stone,slag,recycled concrete and geosynthetic aggregates.Aggregates are the most mined materials in the world.Aggregates are a component of composite materials such as concrete and asphalt concrete; the aggregate serves as.4 Aggregate Specifications and Requirementsaggregate because of water in the pores of the material,but not including water adhering to the outside surface of the particles.Absorption is expressed as a percentage of the dry weight.Absorption requirements are of concern onl y regarding aggregates used in hot mix asphalt and portland cement concrete.The intent is to avoid using highly

## Using ceramic wastes from tile industry as a partial.
The recycled ceramic aggregates were suitable for use in asphalt concrete.• Ceramic aggregate addition to mixture increased binder and air void contents.• Ceramic mixture enhanced plastic deformation,but evidenced water sensitivity.• Up to 30% of ceramic addition in binder courses was fit for medium low traffics.Aggregate Properties You Need to Know: Strength.These resources go into the production of concrete aggregates,asphalt aggregates,and base course materials for every commercial,industrial,and infrastructure project built.Testing for Toughness.In this blog,we'll focus on construction materials tests that measure aggregate characteristics like soundness,toughness,and durability.
