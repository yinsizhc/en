## Extension of Cogeneration Capability by Increasing
The coal pipe size was originally 12" except for the horizontal run which was 10&quot to prevent coal dust deposition.Each pipe had an individual coal plug valve with a manual drive.The primary air flow through the pulverizer is controlled by means of a tandem line damper,installed on each pair of coal pipes,downstream of the coal valves.Coalfired power plant (Principle,Diagram andAdvantages of coalfired power plant: It's known that coal is the most widely used fuels for generating power and electricity around the world which means that the coal fired power plant has many advantages as: It's abundant and easy to burn.It doesn't depend on the weather or existing climatic conditions for mining coal.
