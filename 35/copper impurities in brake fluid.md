## Brake Fluid 101 Brake Fluid and Copper Testing Brake.
Brake Fluid & Copper Testing Brake fluid is the life's blood of the braking system.Just like engine oil,coolant and transmission fluid,brake fluid wears over time.This leaves the brake system unprotected and vulnerable to corrosion.Brake system corrosion can lead to: ABS damage,brake system failure and longer stopping distance.MINI Cooper R56 Brake Bleeding (2007 2011) …2020 2 18&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Removing air bubbles from the brake hydraulics after hydraulic component replacement is referred to as bleeding the brakes.Removing old brake fluid (full of impurities and hygroscopically absorbed water) and replacing it with fresh brake fluid is referred to as flushing the brake fluid.Bleeding and flushing are essentially the same procedure.
