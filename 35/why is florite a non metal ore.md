## Fluorite Wikipedia
Fluorite (also called fluorspar) is the mineral form of calcium fluoride,CaF 2.It belongs to the halide minerals.It crystallizes in isometric cubic habit,although octahedral and more complex isometric forms are not uncommon.The Mohs scale of mineral hardness,based on scratch hardness comparison,defines value 4 as Fluorite.Pure fluorite is transparent,both in visible and ultraviolet.Fluorite : elementcollectionI used uranium ore as a stand in for uranium.For the neodymium on top of it,i used a 0.5 cm cube of neodymium metal.I heard that alpha particles form neutrons near metals and beta gamma forms x rays near metal.
