## Rod Mills Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
End Peripheral discharge and center peripheral discharge rod mills are described in detail on pages 28 and 29.Feed and discharge heads of Rod Mills are conical in shape providing important advantages over a mill with straight heads.1.They provide the essential feed pocket and also a space for the pulp to squeeze from the rod mass.Optimizing your SAG mill operation International MiningIn the past,when primary,secondary and tertiary crushers fed material directly to large ball mills,the energy efficiency of the concentrator was determined for the most part by the ball mill operation,whereas now the energy efficiency of a plant often rests largely on the SAG mill operation.The grate,peripheral discharge trunnion.
