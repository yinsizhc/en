## Cyclone Separator Design,Components and How it …
Components and Design.A reverse flow cyclone separator is an industrial assembly with no moving parts and a simple design.The main cylindrical part of the cyclone separator is known as the body or barrel.The gradually narrowing conical section is known as the cone.Un treated gas enters tangentially through the inlet at the side of the.KREBS gMAXEnhance your fine particle separation with patented hydrocyclone technology Optimum cyclone performance relies on minimising turbulence,while maximising tangential (outer edge) velocity.The gMAX Cyclone focuses on both of these important factors,and the result is a cyclone that provides significantly advanced performance.

Contrary to conventional hydrocyclones,the operating principle of these MixedFlow types,with multiple inlet ports positioned at the periphery of each individual cyclone liner,results in a stabilizing and coalescing effect on the water oil flow.Most available pressure energy is converted in to a rotating motion within the cyclone.The Sizing & Selection of Hydrocyclonescyclone diameter,inlet area,vortex finder,apex orifice,and sufficient length providing retention time to properly classify particles.As with the involuted type design,the graphs and mathematical relationships shown for proper selection and sizing of cyclones apply to the "standard cyclone" geometry.The main parameter is the cyclone.
