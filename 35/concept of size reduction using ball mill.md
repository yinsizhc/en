## size reduction using ball mill
Ball mill Wikipedia.A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.Mill (grinding) WikipediaIn materials processing a grinder is a machine for producing fine particle size reduction through.The power predictions for ball mills typically use the following form of the Bond equation: = (−) where.E is the energy (kilowatt hours per metric or short ton) W is the work index measured in a laboratory ball mill (kilowatt hours per metric or short ton) P 80 is the mill circuit product.
