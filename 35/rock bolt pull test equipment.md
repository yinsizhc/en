## Rock Bolt Testing (Non destructive) Geohart
The traditional pull out tests currently used for rock reinforcement testing is not considered an effective tool for the detection of compromised rock bolt systems used for ground control in underground mining and civil construction industries.Pull out test still have an important role to play in determining critical bond lengths for static.Soft Sandstone Rock Anchor Testing Summary Climb ZATherefore,the worst conservative case is to test rock anchors after 24 hours.The diameter of the hole is sometimes varied for the same diameter glue in anchor.Although this effect was not investigated in detail,it does not seem to be a good practice to insert,for example,a 12mm U Bolt.
