## Beneficiation Wikipedia
In the mining industry or extractive metallurgy,beneficiation is any process that improves (benefits) the economic value of the ore by removing the gangue minerals,which results in a higher grade product (concentrate) and a waste stream ().Examples of beneficiation processes include froth flotation and gravity separation.Other economic uses of the term are in use.COAL BENEFICIATION IIMRaw coal fed on to the vibrating bed having crosswise and vertical slope.Air supplied through air holes in the beneficiation bed which agitates the raw coal resulting in stratification of coal as per its relative densities lighter coal forms the upper layer and heavier coal forms the lower layer.Upper good coal.
