## Roasting (metallurgy) Wikipedia
Roasting is a process of heating of sulphide ore to a high temperature in presence of air.It is a step of the processing of certain ores.More specifically,roasting is a metallurgical process involving gas solid reactions at elevated temperatures with the goal of purifying the metal component(s).Often before roasting,the ore has already been partially purified,e.g.by froth flotation.Gold: Mineral information,data and localities.Gold is one of the first minerals used by prehistoric cultures.The Latin name for this mineral was "aurum" and Jöns Jakob Berzelius used Au to represent the element when he established the current system of chemical symbols.The Old English word "gold" first appeared in written form about 725 and may further have been derived from "gehl" or.
