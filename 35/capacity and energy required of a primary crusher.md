Because each crusher type has a limited reduction capability,sometimes several stages of crushing are needed to achieve the desired final product size.Primary crushers are important for kicking off production and initial product sizing for further processing.They receive the material directly from the blasting,drilling or dredging process.The Evolution of Crushing and Grinding. MINING.comThese adjustments have focused on lowering costs and increasing production and energy efficiency,mainly due to the fact that the mining industry has seen much larger projects and consequently has required substantial crushing equipment.Today,mining companies want lower capital costs with fewer pieces of equipment and higher capacity from each unit,even if the equipment is disposable after.
