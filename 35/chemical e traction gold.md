## Gold extraction
The efficiency and recovery of chemical processes involved in gold extraction is exclusive to the mineralogy of the ore.Gold may exist as free nuggets or particles in alluvial or elluvial deposits or as native metal in other minerals.The gold mineralogy of any given ore deposit is unique to all others due to variations in the following:gold Facts,Properties,& Uses BritannicaGold (Au),chemical element,a dense lustrous yellow precious metal of Group 11 (Ib),Period 6,of the periodic table.Gold has several qualities that have made it exceptionally valuable throughout history.It is attractive in colour and brightness,durable to the point of virtual indestructibility,highly malleable,and usually found in nature in a comparatively pure form.

## Gold extraction Wikipedia
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold.How to Take the Impurities out of Gold LEAFtvSubmerge the unrefined gold in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids.This method will dissolve the ore and separate the gold from the impurities,which can later be washed away.The remaining substances will be just water and gold,the latter having a purity level of more than 99.99 percent.Dry this residue until only gold powder remains.
