## What's the process of iron ore mining? Quora
Jan 20,2017 · Mining iron ore begins at ground level.Taconite is identified by diamond drilling core samples on a grid hundreds of feet into the earth.Taconite rock comprises about 28 percent iron; the rest is sand or silica.These samples are analyzed and ca.Iron processing Iron making BritannicaIron processing Iron processing Iron making: The primary objective of iron making is to release iron from chemical combination with oxygen,and,since the blast furnace is much the most efficient process,it receives the most attention here.Alternative methods known as direct reduction are used in over a score of countries,but less than 5 percent of iron is made this way.
