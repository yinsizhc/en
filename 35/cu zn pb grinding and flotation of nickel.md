## Distribution of Sb minerals in the Cu and Zn flotation …
Flotation tests on Rockliden composite samples have shown that the threshold of 0.2 wt% Sb is exceeded in the Cu Pb concentrate even if the Sb grade of the blended feed material is below this value (Bolin,2010,Minz,2013).This is related not only to the flotation behaviour of common Sb minerals but also to the mineral association and the degree of liberation,which are suspected to.Cu Pb Zn,Copper Lead Zinc Ores,Copper Lead Zinc.Xinhai Cu Pb Zn Ore Dressing Process.It is reported that more than 90% of non ferrous metal ores (copper,lead,zinc,etc.) adopt flotation process,especially for those with fine grain and complex symbiosis.Flotation process can achieve ideal separation effect,and separately recover low grade ore then enrich multiple high grade concentrates.
