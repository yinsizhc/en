## Negative Effects of Coal Mining The World Counts
The negative effects of coal mining cannot be disputed: Destruction of Landscapes and Habitats: Strip mining also known as surface mining,involves the stripping away of earth and rocks to reach the coal underneath.If a mountain happens to be standing in the way of a coal seam within,it will be blasted or levelled effectively leaving aMaps show year by year effects of surface coal mining,Surface mining cleared 2,900 square kilometers of land in that time frame,the study shows Combined with pre 1985 data,researchers found the “cumulative mining footprint” was 5,900 square.

## Monitoring environmental impacts of surface coal mining
Abstract Coal mining generates a number of significant environmental impacts.Due to its synoptic coverage and repetitive data acquisition capabilities,remote sensing has been extensively used to monitor effects of surface mining.Availability of low cost and high resolution data in recent years has focused increased attention on the use of satellite data for monitoring surface mining activity.Surface Coal Mining Impacts Kentucky Waterways AllianceSurface Coal Mining Impacts The practice of surface mining coal in the state of Kentucky is devastating to our health,environment,and ultimately our quality of life Surface coal mining sucks money out of our state while destroying our mountains and polluting our water
