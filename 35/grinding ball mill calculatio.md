## Mill (grinding)
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().「perlite mining wet ball mill」A Laboratory Ball Mill is used for grinding in laboratory flotation test work,wet grinding is necessary in several stages in order to approximate the actual grinding conditions of a ball mill and classifier in plant operation.With this small ball mill it is possible to grind successfully in several stages without dilution,because the large.
