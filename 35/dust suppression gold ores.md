A large iron ore operation experienced high levels of dust and low visibility on haul roads during dry months.The mine turned to Nalco Water to partner on a solution that would help them achieve better,safer results and reduce the cost of treatment compared to a water only dust suppression approach.Lead and Zinc2013 11 8&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Lead and Zinc Lead and zinc ores are usually found together with gold and silver.A lead zinc ore may also contain lead sulfide,zinc sulfide,iron sulfide,iron carbonate,and quartz.When zinc and lead sulfides are present in profitable amounts they are regarded as ore minerals.The remaining rock and minerals are called gangue.
