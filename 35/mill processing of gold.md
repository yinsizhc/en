## Cyanide Leaching Of Gold Mine Engineer.Com
Once the gold has been dissolved in the cyanide,and the ore body has been reasonably depleted of its gold,there are two main processes for recovering the gold from the pregnant cyanide solution.One is the MerrillCrowe zinc precipitation process and the other is the adsorption of the goldHow gold is madeOnce extracted,the gold is refined with one of four main processes: floatation,amalgamation,cyanidation,or carbon in pulp.Each process relies on the initial grinding of the gold ore,and more than one process may be used on the
