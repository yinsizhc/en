The BF BOF route produces steel using raw materials such as iron ore,coal,limestone and steel scrap.About 75% of steel is produced using the BF BOF route.First,iron ores are reduced to iron,also called hot metal or pig iron.Then the iron is converted to steel in the BOF.After casting and rolling and or coating,the steel is delivered as.PRODUCT GUIDEIRON ORE energy — Coal especially — and freight which transports it,is obvious.The relationship between the most important global crude oil benchmark and iron ore may not be the first to come to mind,but as a host to the two leading crude oil benchmarks,the logic of ICE's entry into iron ore is underscored in the following chart:
