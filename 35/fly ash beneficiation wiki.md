## Potassium
6&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Potassium is a chemical element with the symbol K (from Neo Latin kalium) and atomic number 19.Potassium is a silvery white metal that is soft enough to be cut with a knife with little force.Potassium metal reacts rapidly with atmospheric oxygen to form flaky white potassium peroxide in only seconds of exposure.It was first isolated from potash,the ashes of plants,from which its name derives.Boral Resources FlyAshBoral's Carbon Burn Out technology is used to improve the quality of fly ash produced at coal fueled electric generating stations,making the ash suitable for use in concrete and other high value applications.Boral offers harvesting and beneficiation of previously disposed ash—in which ash is excavated,screened,dried,and processed.

## Fly ash — Wikipedia Republished WIKI 2
Fly ash,also known as "pulverised fuel ash" in the United Kingdom,is a coal combustion product composed of fine particles that are driven out of the boiler with the flue gases.Ash that falls in the bottom of the boiler is called bottom ash.In modern coal fired power plants,fly ash is generally captured by electrostatic precipitators or other particle filtration equipment before the flue.fly ash beneficiationFly ash beneficiation process is based on the physical and chemical properties of various components in fly ash can be used in different,flotation,magnetic separation,electricity recovery of valuable minerals selected,gravity separation and chemical mineral processing methods of them,to use.
