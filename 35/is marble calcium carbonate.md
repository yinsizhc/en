## The assessment of anticorrosive behavior of calcium.
Calcium carbonate is common filler used in coatings industry due to its distinctive properties and the variation of its sources.The scope of this work is to study the effect of calcium carbonate developed from different sources (e.g.natural calcite,marble and egg shell wastes) on the corrosion protection performance of anticorrosive coatings.Calcium Carbonate : uses,solubility,structure CaCO3Preparation.Calcium carbonate results directly from the mining of limestone and is extracted by mining or quarrying.Pure calcium carbonate used as an antacid and a food and pharmaceutical additive,can be produced from a pure quarried source such as marble or it can be prepared by passing CO 2 into a solution of hydrated lime (produced from quicklime.
