ASSESSMENT OF AGGREGATE SUITABILITY FOR USE IN ASPHALTIC CONCRETE USING METHYLENE BLUE ADSORPTION VALUE.Some recent occurrences of moisture damage and binder stripping of asphalt pavement in New South Wales have been attributed to the selection and use of aggregates which may be prone to this type of damage.Relationship between methylene blue values of concrete.Even when the microfine material percentage in fine aggregate is low,the methylene blue value of the fine aggregate increases when materials of clay origin are present.In this study,methylene blue values were determined in fine aggregate samples used to produce ready mixed concrete.Samples were taken from four different aggregate quarries.
