## Refining
Chemical refining removes the phosphatides (gums) in either two steps—degumming and neutralizing—or in a single process—neutralizing.Crown’s MaxEfficiency continuous deodorizing system exemplifies our legacy of providing the best,most reliable and innovative oilseed processes and equipment in the world today.How is Iron Refined From the Ore? innovateus.netWhat is the process of refining Iron ore? Iron ore refining process uses heat and another substance,so that oxygen molecule can bond to them and separate from iron.Carbon readily bonds with oxygen and so coal or coke (a form or carbon) is used in the iron ore refining process.

## What are the considerations for smelting iron and aluminum.
Iron ore mainly consists of iron oxides,thus you need to reduce the iron ore,i.e.take away the oxygen.This is done by using carbon from mainly coke.There is research going on to use hydrogen instead of carbon for the reduction of iron ore.Refining (metallurgy) WikipediaIn metallurgy,refining consists of purifying an impure metal.It is to be distinguished from other processes such as smelting and calcining in that those two involve a chemical change to the raw material,whereas in refining,the final material is usually identical chemically to the original one,only it is purer.The processes used&nbsp;.
