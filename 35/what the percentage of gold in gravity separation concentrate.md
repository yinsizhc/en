## Gravity Separation Mining SGS
Gravity separation is an attractive unit operation as it generally has low capital and operating costs,uses few of any chemicals that might cause environmental concerns and the recent development of new equipment enhances the range of separations possible.Copper extraction WikipediaCopper extraction refers to the methods used to obtain copper from its ores.The conversion of copper consists of a series of physical and electrochemical processes.Methods have evolved and vary with country depending on the ore source,local environmental regulations,and other factors.
