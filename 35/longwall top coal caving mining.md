1.Introduction.Longwall Top Coal Caving (LTCC) can provide substantially less economic sensitivity and a reduced level of technical risk over other thick seam mining methods.1 A reliable evaluation of LTCC's applicability at the feasibility stage of a new mining project is therefore of importance to the effective and productive extraction of thick coal seams.3 D numerical modelling of stresses around a longwall.single slice longwall mining.However,in the case of thick seam mining,it is a more difficult task to assess ground movements due to successive caving if slicing or caving of top coal behind the face methods are applied.A better understanding of strata behaviour under existing conditions would facilitate the selection and application of an efficient production strategy.This cannot be.
