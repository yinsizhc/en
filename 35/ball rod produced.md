## Calculate Top Ball Size of Grinding Media Equation & Method
Bond's first developments for grinding ores and rocks are now known as the Bond rod milling and ball milling grindability tests.The grindability results from these tests are still reported as "net grams produced per revolution of the test mill." Bond carried out two studies using his grindability tests:Ball Mills Mineral Processing & MetallurgyBall Rod Mills have heavy rolled steel plate shells which are arc welded inside and outside to the steel heads or to rolled steel flanges,depending upon the type of mill.Forged from the best high carbon manganese steel,they are of the finest quality which can be produced.
