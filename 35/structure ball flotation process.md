## Potash Flotation Process Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Potash ores generally contain 20 to 40 percent KCL with the balance being NaCl and a small amount of clay slime,the latter usually in the order of 1 to 1½%.Flotation has been developed as the principal separating process for the potash salts which generally are coarsely crystalline and free from the sodium salts at about 10 to 14 mesh.Flotation Cells Mineral Processing & MetallurgyThe design of Denver "Sub A" flotation cells incorporates all of the basic principles and requirements of the art,in addition to those of the ideal flotation cell.Its design and construction are proved by universal acceptance and its supremacy is acknowledged by world wide recognition and use.
