## What is Operations Research and Why is it Important?
Operations research (OR) is an analytical method of problem solving and decision making that is useful in the management of organizations.In operations research,problems are broken down into basic components and then solved in defined steps by mathematical analysis.3 Technologies in Exploration,Mining,and Processing.Mining operations are also often conducted in remote locations where access to spare parts and large maintenance facilities may be difficult.Current research has focused on the development of sensor systems that can be incorporated into large vehicles and heavy machinery to monitor continuously the "state of the health" of the vehicle.

## Operations research and data mining
A key intersection of data mining and operations research is in the use of optimization algorithms,either directly applied as data mining algorithms,or used to tune parameters of other algorithms.The literature in this area goes back to the seminal work of Mangasarian (1965) where the problem of separating two classes of points was formulated as a linear program.Operations zijinmining2019 7 4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Add: No.1 Zijin Road,Shanghang County,Longyan City,Fujian Province Postal Code: 364200 Tel: 0592 2933586 Email: international@zijinmining.com
