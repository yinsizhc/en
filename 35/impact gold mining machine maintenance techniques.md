The Mercury Problem in Artisanal Gold Mining.Mercury‐based artisanal and small‐scale gold mining (ASGM) causes more mercury pollution than any other human activity.1 In this practice,mercury metal is used to extract gold from ore as a stable amalgam.The amalgam is then heated to evaporate the mercury and isolate the gold.Dredging WikipediaDredging machines have been used during the construction of the Suez Canal from the late 1800s to present day expansions and maintenance.The completion of the Panama Canal in 1914,the most expensive U.S.engineering project at the time,relied extensively on dredging.
