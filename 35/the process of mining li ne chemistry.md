## Coal Mining and Processing Energy Trends Insider
Due to growth in surface mining and improved mining technology,the amount of coal produced by one miner in one hour has more than tripled since 1978.Surface mining is used to produce most of the coal in the U.S.because it is less expensive than underground mining.Surface mining can be used when the coal is buried less than 200 feet underground.Li JX,Li GM,Qin KZ,Xiao B,Chen L and Zhao JX.2012.Mineralogy and mineral chemistry of the Cretaceous Duolong goldrich porphyry copper deposit in the Bangongco Arc,northern Tibet.Resource Geology,62 (1): 1941.
