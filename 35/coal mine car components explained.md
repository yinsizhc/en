Coal mining greatly increased during the industrial revolution and the following decades.The main mining areas were around Aachen,the Ruhr and Saar area,along with many smaller areas in other parts of Germany.These areas grew and were shaped by coal mining and coal processing,and this is still visible even after the end of the coal mining.How do steam engines work? Who invented steam …When we burn coal on a fire,the bonds break apart and the energy is released in the form of heat.Coal contains about half as much energy per kilogram as cleaner fossil fuels such as gasoline,diesel,and kerosene—and that's one reason why steam engines have to burn so much of it.Photo: The main parts of a steam locomotive.
