## Properties of Blast Furnace Slag Cement Concrete Subjected.
Ground granulated blast furnace slag cement is a supplementary cementitious material (SCM) that is used in concrete,to reduce ordinary Portland cement (OPC) usage.OPC has a negative environmental impact during its production [1].There are di erent GGBS types for concrete works that are distinguished either by their activity index or ﬁneness.Differences between fly ash,slag and silica fume Low.These materials are defined within ASTM C1240 (CSA A23.5) and are typically used where a high degree of impermeability is required.The use of silica fume in concrete will create the effect of the mixture becoming sticky and appropriate adjustments may be required.Fly Ash,Slag and Silica Fume with Impact on Concrete Properties:

## Slag Cement an overview ScienceDirect Topics
If the slag cement particles are finer than the Portland cement particles,the rate of bleeding will decrease,and in contrast,if the slag cement particles are coarser than the Portland cement particles,bleeding will increase when substituted on an equal mass basis.The setting time of concrete containing slag cement is commonly retarded.The Impact of Slag Composition on the Microstructure of.The work presented here focuses on the impact of slag composition on the resistance of slag composite cements exposed to sulfates.Such composite systems can be an effective way to provide better sulfate resistance of the binder.However,the differing composition and hydration kinetics between slag and cement results in a change in the phases present and their quantities,the effect of which.
