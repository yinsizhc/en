## Horizontal Coarse Grinding Mill Rod Mill Product.
The Rod Mill is the same as the Ball Mill in the construction and available to both of wet and dry processing.Unlike the Ball Mill,however,the Rod Mill uses rods instead of balls as the grinding medium.As a result,its uses are different from those with the Ball Mill.In other words,the Rod Mill gives impact on and grinds coarse particles.Rod mills,how they functionRod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.
