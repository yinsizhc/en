Removing the gold bearing rock from the ground is just the first step.To isolate pure gold,mining companies use a complex extraction process.The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces.At a mill,large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.A Look at the Process of Pelletizing Iron Ore for Steel.Iron ore must go through a lengthy pre processing stage before it can be pelletized a series of steps that work to beneficiate and concentrate low grade ores.This process varies depending on the ore source,but typically involves various stages of crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the iron ore.
