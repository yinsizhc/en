## Smelting of Bauxite Residue (Red Mud) in View of Iron and
During acid leaching of bauxite residue (red mud),the increase in dissolution of rareearth elements (REEs) is associated with an increase in iron dissolution,which poses problems in the downstream processing.Therefore,it would be beneficial to remove iron from bauxite residue by smelting reduction.The slag generated in the smelting reduction process could then be further processed for.for treating bauxite in which a desilication product and.2003420 A process in which alumina is extracted from bauxite with an aqueous alkali solution,and a desilication product is precipitated such that t.
