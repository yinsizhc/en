Macadam is a type of road construction,pioneered by Scottish engineer John Loudon McAdam around 1820,in which single sized crushed stone layers of small angular stones are placed in shallow lifts and compacted thoroughly.A binding layer of stone dust (crushed stone from the original material) may form; it may also,after rolling,be covered with a binder to keep dust and stones together.What is Superpave?
