## Eliminating Copper from Gold Ore
When reviewing Methods of Eliminating Copper from Gold Ores we see that several methods have been suggested to eliminate copper from ores prior to cyanidation.Preliminary extraction of the copper with sulphuric or sulphurous acids may be applicable to ores containing oxidized copper minerals such as malachite,azurite and chrysocolla but these acids have but little effect on sulphide copper.copper ore processing plant iron magnetic separatorJun 16,2012 · copper ore processing plant and crushing machine.In the event you require basalt crushing plant or you want to know more info about basalt crusher and basalt grinding mill,please really feel free to contact us by click the con line chat button for free chat with our specialists.

## Mining
Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension stone,rock salt,potash,gravel,and clay.Methods of Gold MiningOther gold mines use underground mining,where the ore is extracted through tunnels or shafts.South Africa has the world's deepest hard rock gold mine up to 3,900 metres (12,800 ft) underground.At such depths,the heat is unbearable for humans,and air conditioning is required for the safety of the workers.
