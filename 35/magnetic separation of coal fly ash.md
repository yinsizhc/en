## Magnetite and Carbon Extraction from Coal Fly Ash Using.
In this study,enrichment methods for coal fly ash (CFA) from Omsk thermal power station No.4 (TPS 4) were investigated.The magnetite and unburned carbon concentrates were obtained by magnetic separation and flotation methods.The wet magnetic separation used in the study increased the magnetite content in the magnetic fraction from 10.48 to 12.72 wt % compared to dry magnetic separation.INVESTIGATION OF DUAL CHANNEL LOW NO x.In order to decreasing the pulverized coal thermal power plant NOx emission damage to human and environment,low NOx pulverized coal combustors are utilized widely.But if the low NOx pulverized coal combustors are operated incorrectly,the fly ash carbon will.
