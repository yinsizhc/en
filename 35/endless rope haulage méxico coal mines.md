In British practice the speed of the rope may be from 1&#189; to 4 miles an hour,2 miles per hour being a common speed.In some American mines high speed,endless rope haulage is adopted,but on the whole it does not seem to offer any material advantage over the slow speed system.Systems of Mining ore,feet,mines,tons,belt,example.Endless rope haul age is in use at many mines.Railway Haulage.—At nearly all large mines,the major part of the surface haulage is on the scale of railroad operations.For example,in the Minnesota iron mines,and copper mines in the West where the mining is done by steam shovels,the ore is loaded direct into 40 or 50 ton steel cars.
