## Ball Mills an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Ball mills are filled up to 40% with steel balls (with 30 80 mm diameter),which effectively grind the ore.The material that is to be ground fills the voids between the balls.The tumbling balls capture the particles in ball ball or ball liner events and load them to the point of fracture.Comparing ball and vertical mills performance: An.smaller values than those for ball mills in some points.This is due the wear of cyclones apexes and,consequently,the increase on vertical mill circulating load,which reached values over 500% by the end of the year.Unfortunately,due to the difficulty to access the cyclones of the vertical mill,its maintenance was compromised.
