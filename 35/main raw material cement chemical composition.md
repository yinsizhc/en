## The chemical composition of mineral trioxide aggregate
Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is composed of Portland cement,with 4:1 addition of bismuth oxide added so that the material can be detected on a radiograph.The cement is made up of calcium,silicon and aluminium.The main constituent phases are tricalcium.Cement WikipediaGreen cement is a cementitious material that meets or exceeds the functional performance capabilities of ordinary Portland cement by incorporating and optimizing recycled materials,thereby reducing consumption of natural raw materials,water,and energy,resulting in a more sustainable construction material.One is Geopolymer cement.

## How Cement Is Made
Portland cement is the basic ingredient of concrete.Concrete is formed when portland cement creates a paste with water that binds with sand and rock to harden.Cement is manufactured through a closely controlled chemical combination of calcium,silicon,aluminum,iron and other ingredients.Chemical composition Cement ScienceThe C S H gel is the main material to bind different particles and resulting in the engineering strength which is needed as a construction material.Since the set and hardening process of cement is chemical reaction,so we can get cement set under water.Cement (Source: Wikipedia) As for the chemical composition of cement,there are four.
