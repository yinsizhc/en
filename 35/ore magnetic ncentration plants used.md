## magnetic ncentrationseperationguality of uranium ore
Uranium ore is mined in several ways: by open pit,underground,in situ leaching,and borehole mining (see uranium mining).Low grade uranium ore mined typically contains 0.01 to 0.25% uranium oxides.Extensive measures must be employed to extract the metal from its ore.MagnetiteThe ore is composed of magnetite and gangue minerals,which are mainly quartz.The flow sheet includes three stages of grinding and magnetic separation once again to reject quartz as early as possible.Vibrating screens are again used to take out unliberated coarse quartz particles,which are returned to the ball mill for regrinding.
