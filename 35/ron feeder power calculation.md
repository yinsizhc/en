## Calculation of Multiplication Factor. Electrical Concepts
 · Energy Meters are one of the important instrument to account for energy imported exported in an industry.In Power Generating Stations,the cumulative reading of such energy meters are used for the calculation of total Million Units (MUs) of energy exported.On the basis of MUs,total revenue generated by the Station is calculated.Calculate Technical Losses of Transmission Distribution.Mar 01,2014 · Introduction: There are two types of Losses in transmission and distribution Line.(1) Technical Losses and (2) Commercial Losses.It is necessary to calculate technical and commercial losses.Normally Technical Losses and Commercial Losses are calculated separately.Transmission (Technical) Losses are directly effected on electrical tariff but Commercial losses are not implemented.
