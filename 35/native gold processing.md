## Gold parting Wikipedia
Gold parting is the separating of gold from silver.Gold and silver are often extracted from the same ores and are chemically similar and therefore hard to separate.Over the centuries special means of separation have been invented.The very earliest precious metals had mixes of gold and silver; gold and silver alloy is called electrum.With the advent of coinage,methods had to be invented to.Precious Metal Ores,Gold,Platinum,Silver and CopperNative silver metal does occur in certain places,but unlike gold,it is fairly uncommon.Native silver forms from secondary processes during weathering.Like many base metals,silver can concentrate during the weathering process,forming rich bonanza grade secondary ores from primary ores that are low to moderate in grade.

What is Native Gold Mineral Processing Metallurgy.Native gold always contains silver,which occurs in varying proportions,the colour becoming paler with the increase of silver.The finest native gold yet found is that from the Pike's Peak Mine,Cripple Creek,which was 999 fine.Copper extraction WikipediaThe processing techniques depend on the nature of the ore.For special native copper bearing ore bodies or sections of ore bodies rich in supergene native copper.gold,selenium,and tellurium settle to the bottom of the cell as anode slime,which forms a salable byproduct.Copper(II) ions migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode.

## Gold Metallurgy
The feasibility study was completed in 1974,and in 1975 Mountain States Engineers were retained to design and build the plant.Processing of ore began in March of 1977 with the first bullion poured in April of that year.The plant is currently processing some 2200 TPD of ore with a grade of four ounces of silver and 0.03 oz.of gold per ton of.Extracting Gold HowStuffWorksRemoving the gold bearing rock from the ground is just the first step.To isolate pure gold,mining companies use a complex extraction process.The first step in this process is breaking down large chunks of rock into smaller pieces.At a mill,large machines known as crushers reduce the ore to pieces no larger than road gravel.
