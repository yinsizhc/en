## Modelling the Minerals Diversity: a Challenge for Ore.
material,to simulate plant operations and display results on tables and graphics.Mineral processing is the industry which transforms the ore issued from the mine or the quarry to a concentrate (e.g.in the case of copper,zinc or lead) or to the final product (e.g.carbonate,kaolin or gold).What Does Gold Ore Look Like? Sciencing · To the untrained eye,gold ore may look like rock with copper tones flowing within it.However,professional prospectors know how to recognize gold ore within a multitude of minerals.Recognizing the look and the location of gold ore is easier if you know how to find lode and placer deposits.General descriptions of.

Gold ore can be classified as free milling,complex,or refractory and each type of ore has different challenges when it comes to processing methods.Cyanidation with CIL CIP continues to be the most common method,although there are environmental concerns due to toxicity.Gold Geoscience AustraliaFree milling ore is the name for when gold can be recovered by crushing,grinding and cyanidation (treatment with a dilute cyanide solution) without additional processing.In refractory ore the gold is locked in sulphide minerals,so to achieve satisfactory levels of gold recovery additional processing is required before cyanidation.

## How Is Gold Extracted From Gold Ore? Sciencing
Gold is usually found alone or alloyed with mercury or silver,but can also be found in ores such as calaverite,sylvanite,nagyagite,petzite and krennerite.Most gold ore now comes from either open pit or underground mines.The ores sometimes contain as little as 5 100 of an ounce of gold …mineral processing of ultra fine gold oresA "refractory" gold ore is an ore that has ultra fine gold particles disseminated throughout its gold occluded minerals.These ores are naturally resistant to recovery by standard cyanidation and carbon adsorption processes.These refractory ores require pre treatment in order for cyanidation to be effective in recovery of the gold.
