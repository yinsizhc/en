The steel framed building will weigh only 2.6 Tons (2,600 kg).So the concrete building is over 12 times heavier! This is for single storey structures in multi storey structures,the difference will be less,as the floors in multi storey steel buildings are built of concrete slabs for economy .Demolition WikipediaDemolition,or razing,is the science and engineering in safely and efficiently tearing down of buildings and other man made structures.Demolition contrasts with deconstruction,which involves taking a building apart while carefully preserving valuable elements for reuse purposes.For small buildings,such as houses,that are only two or three stories yards high,demolition is a rather simple.
