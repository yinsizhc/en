## Introduction to Mineral Processing
In ore beneficiation,flotation is a process in which valuable minerals are separated from worthless material or other valuable minerals by inducing them to gather in and on the surface of a froth layer.Sulfide and non sulfide minerals as well as native metals are recovered by froth flotation.Dense Heavy Medium Separation HMS DMS ProcessDense medium separation (or heavy medium separation (HMS),or the sink and float process) is applied to the pre concentration of minerals,i.e.the rejection of gangue prior to grinding for final liberation.It is also used in coal preparation to produce a commercially graded end product,clean coal being separated from the heavier shale or high ash coal.
