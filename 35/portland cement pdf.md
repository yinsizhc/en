## Portland Cement
Portland Cement.Portland cement is a calcium alumina silicate compound and is manufactured from limestone and clay (or shale) with minor amounts of iron oxide,silica sand and alumina as additives where required to balance the mineral composition.Safety Data Sheet Portland CementDANGER! Overexposure to portland cement can cause serious,potentially irreversible skin or eye damage in the form of chemical (caustic) burns,including third degree burns.The same serious injury can occur if wet or moist skin has prolonged contact exposure to dry portland cement.Portland cement is not classifiable as a human carcinogen.

Portland cement,the most common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic ingredient of concrete,mortar,stucco,and non speciality grout,was developed in England in the mid 19th century,and usually originates from limestone.James Frost produced what he called "British cement" in a similar manner around the same time,but did not obtain a patent until 1822.Material Safety Data Sheet For Portland CementAsh Grove Cement Company Portland Cement Page 3 Chronic Effects: Dry portland cement can cause inflammation of the lining of the nose and the cornea.Repeated exposure to portland cement may result in drying of the skin and may lead to thickening,cracking,or fissuring of the
