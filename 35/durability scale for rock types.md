Rock Science Experiments: Vinegar and Limestone Test.There are a few ways to test rocks one of the most popular ways is to test a rock's hardness using the Mohs Scale which we've shared before.In my opinion,today's test is much more fun! This time,instead of testing the property of a rock,we're going to test for a specific type of rock.Understanding Rockwell Hardness in Knives at KnifeArt.comHRc refers to the Rockwell Scale of Hardness,part C.The Rockwell scale is widely used by metallurgists to define just how hard a piece of steel is: the higher the number,the harder the steel.A particular metal's rating is important to the knife maker because a harder steel will hold an edge better than a softer steel.
