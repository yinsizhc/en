## Heap Leaching Oxide and Sulfide Copper Ores
Heap leaching is a simple means of recovering copper from oxide and oxide sulfide ores.Although this method requires relatively low capital investment,it suffers from low copper recoveries and relatively high acid consumption.Effect of Sulfide Concentration on the Corrosion and.The effect of sulfide concentration on the corrosion and cavitation erosion behavior of a cast manganese aluminum bronze (MAB) alloy in 3.5% NaCl solution was investigated.The electrochemical results showed that when the sulfide concentration exceeded 50 ppm,hydrogen evolution reaction dominated the cathodic process because of the very negative corrosion potential of MAB,and the formation.

## metallurgy Definition & History Britannica
The discovery of the value of tin may have occurred through the use of stannite,a mixed sulfide of copper,iron,and tin,although this mineral is not as widely available as the principal tin mineral,cassiterite,which must have been the eventual source of the metal.The oxidation of copper sulfide minerals during …In this study,the mechanism which underpins the different interactions of chalcopyrite,a primary copper sulfide mineral,and chalcocite,a secondary copper sulfide mineral,with bentonite,a clay mineral,during the grinding with stainless steel media was investigated by a range of techniques including XPS (X ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy) analysis,electrokinetic studies and Cryo SEM.
