## Copper Mining and Processing: Processing of Copper …
Copper processing is a complicated process that begins with mining of the ore (less than 1% copper) and ends with sheets of 99.99% pure copper called cathodes,which will ultimately be made into products for everyday use.The most common types of ore,copper oxide and copper sulfide,undergo two different processes,hydrometallurgy and pyrometallurgy,respectively,due to the different.SulphideThe addition of a small amount of manganese dioxide in the thiosulfate leaching of the sulfide bearing gold ores improved both the kinetics and the overall gold extractions without much impact on thiosulfate consumption (Feng and van Deventer,2007c).However,in the presence of excess manganese dioxide,thiosulfate can be oxidized by MnO 2.

## What is Sulfide Mining? Mining Action Group
Metallic sulfide mining (aka hard rock mining) is the practice of extracting metals such as nickel,gold and copper from a sulfide rich ore body.Sulfides are a geologic byproduct of mining in this area,and by exposing sulfides to the air and water in our atmosphere,sulfuric acid can be created — threatening to poison the nearby water.Photos of gold ores,quartz,telluride gold ore and gold.Gold and silver are obtained from a variety of ores.Most people think of nuggets and such,but the truth is that very little comes from nuggets nearly all newly mined gold comes from ores mined from the natural hard rocks that contain gold in tiny,even microscopic particles.
