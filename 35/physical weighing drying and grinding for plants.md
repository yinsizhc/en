## Factors Affecting Ball Mill Grinding Efficiency
The following are factors that have been investigated and applied in conventional ball milling in order to maximize grinding efficiency: a) Mill Geometry and Speed Bond (1954) observed grinding efficiency to be a function of ball mill diameter,and established empirical relationships for recommended media size and mill speed that take this factor into account.As well,mills with different.Sphagnum Peat Moss Influence On Physical Properties Of.The physical properties of growing media that sphagnum peat moss mainly affects are: bulk density (which is the dry or wet weight (mass) of the growing medium),water holding capacity (which is the volume percentage of water retained after a saturated growing medium is allowed to drain),and air porosity (which is the measurement of the volume.
