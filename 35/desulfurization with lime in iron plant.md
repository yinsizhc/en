## Dephosphorization and Desulfurization of Molten Ductile.
("Dephosphorization and Desulfurization Pig Iron by Na2CO3" by Takaharu Mori Ya and Masanobu Fujii) Na2CO3 has also been used in the ductile iron desulfurization.But the practice tells it does not have any considerable impact on the dephosphorization in the case of ductile iron.Blending lime and iron waste to improve sorbents.Lime and iron waste were blended in various ratios and the resulting sorbents tested in two equipments namely; pH stat apparatus simulating wet flue gas desulfurization (FGD) and fixed bed reactor for dry FGD,to investigate the effect of the blends in the FGD process.The best blend was found at a ratio of 1:2 (lime to iron waste) by mass.
