## Fire Detection Methods for Coal Pulverizer Systems
The Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) performed an extensive investigation on fire detection for coal pulverizer or mill systems.The studies showed that there is an emergence of low rank,high reactive coals as a base fuel for power plants which is resulting in an increase in pulverizer.EXPLOITATION PROBLEMS OF COAL PULVERIZERS2018 9 12&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;volatiles content.However,poorly prepared coal dust coming from the best energy coal,can seriously disrupt the combustion process.It manifests itself by power unit efficiency reduction because of the unburned fuel.Coal pulverizers are working in the groups of devices,which includes the coal feeder,mill,electric motors and fan.

## Fire and Explosion Hazards in Cement Manufacturing.
Coal is often the main fuel source used to heat the cement kiln.Coal pulverizers are required to grind the coal from the bulk storage size to a smaller particle diameter to use in the kiln.Coal pulverizers significantly reduce the mean particle size of the coal,drastically increasing the fire.Power plant fire protection & extinguishing systems.Perfect protection for complex requirements In complex environments like power plants,having a comprehensive fire protection plan and reliable extinguishing systems is essential to ensure the safety of workers and for the continuous supply of electrical power.On this page you will learn more about power plant fire protection.
