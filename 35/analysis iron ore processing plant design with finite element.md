## Ore Treatment an overview ScienceDirect Topics
Iron ore processing by Rio Tinto in the Pilbara region of Western Australia does not involve any chemical treatment.Flowsheets for the Brockman 2 and Paraburdoo processing plants are given in Figures 8.4 and 8.5 (Kinnel,2013).The flowsheets are relatively simple.Dry processing involves up to three crushing circuits to produce lump and fines.Mining WikipediaMining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the Earth,usually from an ore body,lode,vein,seam,reef or placer deposit.These deposits form a mineralized package that is of economic interest to the miner.Ores recovered by mining include metals,coal,oil shale,gemstones,limestone,chalk,dimension stone,rock salt,potash,gravel,and clay.
