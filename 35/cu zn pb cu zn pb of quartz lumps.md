## Origin of epithermal Ag Au Cu Pb Zn mineralization in.
Mineralization consists dominantly of silver sulfides and sulfosalts,base metal sulfides (mostly chalcopyrite,galena,sphalerite,and pyrite),and electrum.There is a broad zonation of metal distribution,with up to 10 % Cu+Pb+Zn in the deeper mines along the …Diverse and multistage Mo,Au,Ag Pb Zn and Cu deposits in.Various polymetallic deposits have been discovered in the Xiong'er Terrane,such as porphyry Mo,carbonatite hosted type Mo,quartz vein type Mo,breccia pipes type Au and orogenic type Au,Ag Pb Zn deposits,indicating that diverse significant mineralization occurred in the Xiong'er Terrane.

The analyses measured comparable concentrations of Zn and Pb,though the deposit is very Zn rich (8%) relative to Pb (0.5%).This inconsistency can be explained invoking a different behaviour of Zn and Pb in response to changes in the physical chemical conditions,which led to Zn precipitation as sphalerite while Pb remained mostly soluble.The Paleozoic Mount Carlton deposit,Bowen Basin.Mount Carlton is a Paleozoic high sulfidation epithermal deposit located in the northern segment of the Bowen Basin,northeast Queensland,Australia.The deposit is hosted in Early Permian volcanic and sedimentary rocks,and an open pit mining operation includes the Au rich V2 pit in the northeast and the Ag rich A39 pit in the southwest.
