## African Iron Production and Iron Working Technologies,
Iron production was a particularly important precolonial African technology,with iron becoming a central component of socioeconomic life in many societies across the continent Iron bearing ores are much more abundant in the earth’s crust than those of copper,and in Africa,iron was recovered from these ores using the bloomery process,until the importation of European iron in the later.Iron Ore &amp; Global Markets.
