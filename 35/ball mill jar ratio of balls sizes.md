Ball mills can be used to further break down or refine a single material,or you can place multiple materials into a ball mill jar to mix as you pulverize this is a very common industrial solution for mixing glazes that require the smallest of mesh sizes.Ball mills basically function like a mortar and pestle,but on a much larger scale.Ball MillThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
