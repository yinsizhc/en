## Iron ore pelletization
There was an intensive study as early as in 1943 at the University of Minnesota on the pelletizing process given the necessity of using taconite (Ball et al.1973).In 1955,two pelletizing plants commenced operation in the United States with an annual production rate of 12 Mt (Meyer,1980; Jiang et al.1996).Bentonite Properties are Unique A Layman's Guide to.Bentonite properties make it very useful in mud rotary drilling? The word ''mud'' in common everyday usage simply means wet dirt.Note: The content on this page has been adapted from publications of Lifewater International,authored by Fred Proby.But in well drilling,the term ''drilling mud'' means a carefully engineered drilling fluid.
