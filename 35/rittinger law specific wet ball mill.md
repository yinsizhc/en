## Unit Operations in Food Processing
Equation (11.3) is known as Rittinger's Law.As the specific surface of a particle,the surface area per unit mass,is proportional to 1 L,eqn.(11.3) postulates that the energy required to reduce L for a mass of particles from 10 cm to 5 cm would be the same as that required to reduce,for example,the same mass of 5 mm particles down to 4.7.How it Works: Crushers,Grinding Mills and Pulverizers.Crushers,grinding mills and pulverizers are types of grinding equipment used to transform or reduce a coarse material such as stone,coal,or slag into a smaller,finer material.including Rittinger’s Law,Kick’s Law,and Bond’s Law.The feed enters one end of the ball mill,and discharges out the other end.Ball mills vary.
