## A Survey of Methods for Gas Lift Optimization
The system considered comprised the production wells,the surface facility model and included a number of operating constraints.Although other forms of artificial lift (sucker rod pump and electric submersible pumps) were considered,the scheme can equally be applied to a gas lift scenario.Artificial lift WikipediaArtificial lift refers to the use of artificial means to increase the flow of liquids,such as crude oil or water,from a production well.Generally this is achieved by the use of a mechanical device inside the well (known as pump or velocity string) or by decreasing the weight of the hydrostatic column by injecting gas into the liquid some distance down the well.

1997 3 4&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;Natural gas has been traditionally utilized as lift gas for purposes of promoting crude oil lift from the reservoir rock in depleted wells (low reservoir pressure).Natural gas is injected at a deep point of the tubing as from the annulus in the well through a hole in the column,in an artificial lift process referred to as gas lift.Artificial lift PetroWikiSix Primary Methods of Artificial Lift.Figure 1 1 Examples of the primary methods of artificial lift.GAS LIFT.Gas lift is a natural flow process in that the reservoir pressure is the driving energy to push fluid to the wellbore,up to the wellhead,and into the surface facility.

## How Does Artificial Lift Work? Ships Aviation & Offshore.
Aug 03,2010 · Artificial lift is a process used on oil wells to increase pressure within the reservoir and encourage oil to the surface.When the natural drive energy of the reservoir is not strong enough to push the oil to the surface,artificial lift is employed to recover more production.While some wells contain enough pressure for oil.Applications of line pack model of gas flow in.The continuous method uses gas injection with a steady state flow to lift oil from the bottom of the tubing to the surface (Guo et al.2007).The intermittent gas lift method uses gas injections at regular intervals (Brown and Beggs,1980).Intermittent gas lift operations are showed in Fig.1.Intermittent gas lift operation consist of surface and subsurface facilities.
