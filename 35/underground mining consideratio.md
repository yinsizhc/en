## Underground Mining for Meeting Environmental Concerns A.
Underground mining can be considered to be more acceptable than surface mining from environmental and social perspectives since,it often has a smaller footprint than an open pit of comparable capacity.The main advantage of underground mining compared to surface mining is that in general only the ore is extracted and waste rock is left behind.Underground Ramp Design Parameters QueensMineDesignWikiProper consideration of each design element ensures ramps are built optimally to perform their desired functions at the lowest possible cost.Ramp Use There are many differing requirements for ramps in underground mining operations with varying degrees of importance to the mines output.

## Planning Considerations For Transition. Cave Mining Forum
Key considerations to evaluate are: open pit stability,shaft stability,dilution,mud rushes and air blasts,and mining method selection.Planning Considerations The efficient transition from open pit mining to an underground operation requires extensive planning.For a large mining operation,planning could last as long as 20 years.Underground Mining Mineral Processing & MetallurgyAnother important economic consideration in underground mining is the extent of water recovery because it’s very difficult to remove all of the ore in underground mining operation.Invariably,as underground operations progress and excavations become larger it becomes necessary to leave amounts of the ore body behind to support the roof in.
