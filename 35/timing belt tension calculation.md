May 02,2007 · I just replaced the timing belt and the repair manual states that you should turn the crankshaft pully bolt counter clockwise about 1 4 turn then tighten the adjustment bolt on the tensioner.I did that and it seems like the belt is still too tight.What is the proper amount of deflection on the timing belt? Right now there is about 1 8 inch deflection.I would appreciate any answers.Two Pulley Connecting Belt Design and Calculations.mechanics machines.Two Pulley Connecting Belt Design and Calculations.Mechanics & Machine Calculations.The following equations will determine: Speed Ration,Arc of contact,Tension ration for belt about to slip,Power Capacity,Pulley Torque,Initial Tension
