## The Sizing &amp; Selection of Hydrocyclones
2016 12 19&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;THE SIZING AND SELECTION OF HYDROCYCLONES By Richard A.Arterburn For many years,hydrocyclones,commonly referred to as cyclones,have been extensively utilized in the classification of particles in comminution circuits.The practical range of classification for cyclones is 40 microns to 400 microns,with some remote applications as fine as 5.8 Centrifugal separation2015 4 13&ensp;&#0183;&ensp;8 Centrifugal separation The basic equations for most centrifugal modelling were introduced in Chapter 5.The liquid drag force was given in equation (5.4),under streamline flow,and the centrifugal field force was provided in equation (5.18).It is a simple matter to equate these to arrive at an
