## 7 Tips for Maximizing Electroless Nickel Plating.
&lt;p”&gt; The electroless nickel (EN) plating process produces a nickel phosphorous coating that can be used to enhance corrosion and wear resistance,or increase surface hardness.Electroless nickel plating does not require the introduction of an electric current into the plating bath.Instead,the plating occurs via chemical reaction.Key EN plating advantages include the …What Is Porosity in Electroplating? Sharretts Plating.In many applications,the electroplated surface of a product needs to be smooth and consistent to ensure proper functionality.In the telecommunications industry,especially,imperfections on the surface of a connector can lead to electrical resistance and poor performance.Modern electroplating methods allow for the production of high quality finished parts.However,a range of variables.

## Properties and applications of electroless nickel
Electroless nickel plating is a process for depositing a nickel alloy from aqueous solutions onto a substrate without the use of electric current.It differs,therefore,from electro .chemical process with no current flow involved,the rate of nickel deposition on all areas should be equal,provided uniform solution conditions are maintained.Viasystems Surface Finishes Welcome to the Surface Mount,• Electroless Ni layer of 120 240 &#181;” deposited on the copper surface • Coated with an electroless palladium layer (4 to 20 &#181;”) • Topped with immersion gold (2 to 8 &#181;”)
