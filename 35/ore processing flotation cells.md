## Jameson cell Wikipedia
The flotation process and related flotation cells are widely used for treating metallic and nonmetallic ores and in addition,it is receiving an ever widening application in other industries.A greater tonnage of ore is treated by flotation than by any other single process.Practically all the metallic minerals are being recovered by the flotation process and the range of non metallics.Mineral Processing McClelland Laboratories Inc Reno (775.Gravity SeparationFroth Flotation.Mineral Processing.If the mineralogy of the ore shows that you can separate discrete particles of the mineral you want from the gangue components of the ore,then it is possible to physically concentrate the valuable mineral and reject the rest.
