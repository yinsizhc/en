## The Best Acrylic Paints: Review of Top 10 Sets at WoWPencils
Jan 15,2020 · The texture of paint is thick,but it's just the right grade of thickness.Thus,all the paints blend,mix,and can be applied smoothly.As for the surfaces that Aem Hi Arts deal with,there is no particular recommendation.They spread wonderfully whether it's on a piece of wood or a stone.For sure,this kit will be useful for any purpose.Casein vs Gouache vs Acrylic WetCanvas · One tricky thing is that each stroke tends to stand on its own more than gouache and oil (in these blending is more easy).It is very high key (light and velvety),sort of like gouache,but I would say that is even higher key,if that is possible.The most obvious thing is that the ultramarine blue is almost like a cobalt blue in other media.
