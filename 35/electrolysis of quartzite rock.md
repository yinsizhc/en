## what mass of gold can you extract from 34.94g of AuCl3.
chemistry.what mass of gold can you extract from 34.94g of AuCl3 using electrolysis of an aqueous solution? asked by Linda on March 8,2017; Chemistry.A chemist wants to extract the gold from 15.0g of gold(II) chloride dihydrate,AuCl3 â€¢ 2H20,What mass of gold could be obtained from this sample?Diffusion of ions through hardened cement pastes.Diffusion of Na + and Cl − ions through thin hardened paste section was determined as a function of water cement ratio,curing time,curing temperature,and diffusion temperature.Diffusivities of Na + ions were smaller than for Cl − ions in the temperature range measured up to 60&#176;C.Activation energies for diffusion were calculated,and contrasts were made with diffusion through a low.
