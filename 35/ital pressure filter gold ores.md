Many mesothermal gold quartz deposits are localized along high angle reverse or reverse oblique shear zones within greenstone belt terrains.Characteristically,these fault hosted vein deposits exhibit a mixed "brittle ductile" style of deformation (discrete shears and vein fractures as well as a schistose shear zone fabric) developed under greenschist facies metamorphic conditions.Cupric chloride CuCl2 PubChemCupric chloride,for injection,is a sterile,nonpyrogenic solution intended for use as an additive to solutions for Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN).Copper chloride appears as a yellowishbrown powder (the anhydrous form) or a green crystalline solid (the dihydrate).Noncombustible but hydrogen chloride gas may form when heated in a fire.
