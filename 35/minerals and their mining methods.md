## 3 DEPLETION OF MINERAL RESOURCES Mineral Resources and.
At first glance,sustainability and mineral resource development appear to be in conflict.Mining depletes finite resources and in a strict sense,therefore,is inherently unsustainable.For instance,there is only a finite amount of copper in the earth's crust,and each unit of copper extracted.What are the main methods of mining? American.There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.

The minerals can range from precious metals and iron to gemstones and quartz.In ancient times,miners recognized a mineral rock formation from its outcrop at the surface.Modern mining technology uses geophysical techniques that involve measuring the magnetic,gravity and sonic responses of rocks above and around a prospective mineral ore body.A Brief Introduction to the Types of Surface Mining …These surface mining methods are considered to be more efficient and economical in extracting minerals as compared to most methods of underground mining.In fact,it can extract almost 90% of ore from a deposit.For this reason,surface mining is the most

The abundance or otherwise the absence of minerals determines in a large measure their commercial exploitation.Ores vary in their metal content.Generally the higher grade ores are more economic to work,not only because they yield large amount of metal but also because their higher metal content makes them easier and cheaper to smelt.Mining: A Brief OverviewUnderground Mining.Underground mining includes techniques and methods used to extract metals,ores and minerals that lie deep within the earth and cannot be taken out with surface mining techniques.In these types of mining techniques,an entrance point is made from the earth’s surface,which is in the form of a mine shaft,an adit or a tunnel.

## Mining.:.Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform
Minerals are essential for modern living,and mining is still the primary method of their extraction.To date,it appears that the main constraints to sustainability in the mining sector derive from the ever increasing demand for mined resources,the consumption of resources (mostly energy and water) needed to extract and process metals,and the increasing pollution generated by the extraction.Extraction of Resources GeologyOpen pit mining,or open cast mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunneling into the earth,such as long wall mining.

## What are the main methods of mining? American …
There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.In situ mining.110 Different Types of Mining Operations and MinesThere are two basic types of mining: mining underground and mining at the earth’s surface.Nearly two thirds of the world’s solid minerals are mined through surface mining.It is especially predominant in obtaining items such as coal,copper,sand,gravel,crushed stone,iron,aluminum,and phosphates.
