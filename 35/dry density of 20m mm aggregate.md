## Coarse Aggregate Specific Gravity
AASHTO T 85 and ASTM C 127: Specific Gravity and Absorption of Coarse Aggregate Background Specific gravity is a measure of a material’s density (mass per unit volume) as compared to the density of water at 73.4 F (23 C).Therefore,by definition,water at adry density of recycled aggregatesourc Recycled concrete aggregate samples were made of aggregate sizes between 5 mm and 20 mm,and the maximum size of natural aggregates used was 20 mm Their results showed that the density of recycled concrete aggregate was 3% to 10% less than that of natural aggregate and the water absorption of recycled concrete aggregate was 3 to 5.Get Price
